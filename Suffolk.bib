Abstract = {{Final consonant cluster simplification, or what variationists have
   traditionally labelled (t, d)-deletion, remains one of the most well
   studied variables in the analysis of English (e.g. Labov, 2001: 13). In
   this body of work, (t, d)-deletion refers to the process whereby /t/ or
   /d/ can be omitted in word final Ct or Cd coda clusters (e.g.last,
   mind). However, despite the attention paid to this feature of connected
   speech, very little (if any) focus has been dedicated to the
   complementary distribution of the coronal stops /t/ and /d/ in
   monomorphemic final clusters, as well as other phonological influences,
   such as the effect of intonational boundaries (IBs) on deletion
   patterns. This has led to a consistent practice of analysing (t, d) as a
   single linguistic variable, instead of considering the value of their
   separation, based on both sound linguistic reasoning and empirical
   evidence. After a brief review of current literature on multivariate
   analyses of (t, d)-deletion, this paper presents a socio-phonologically
   oriented research design that has been used to gather data from a
   peripheral southeastern variety of English. We martial these data to
   illustrate how (t) and (d) can be modelled as distinct dependent
   variables that are sensitive to particular factor groups: we focus in
   particular on the role of IBs in the deletion process.}},

Abstract = {{East Anglian English was the first British variety of English to be
   subject to dialectological scrutiny using sociolinguistic techniques
   (Trudgill, 1974, and his subsequent work) and since then has been
   subject to only sporadic investigation (e.g. Britain, 1991, 2014a,
   2014b, 2015; Kingston, 2000; Straw, 2006; Amos, 2011; Potter, 2012,
   2018; Butcher, 2015). Recent research has suggested that, in those few
   locations that have been investigated, East Anglian English is gradually
   losing some of its traditional dialect features, in favour of forms from
   the South East more generally. Kingston (2000), Britain (2014a) and
   Potter (2018) all found, for example, a rather steep decline in the use
   of East Anglia's traditional third-person present-tense zero.
   Furthermore, we are aware of the arrival into East Anglia of linguistic
   innovations from the South East of England, such as TH fronting
   (Trudgill, 1988; Britain, 2005; Potter, 2012) and /l/ vocalisation
   (Johnson \& Britain, 2007; Potter, 2014), but we only know about their
   success in a few parts of the region - Norwich, East Suffolk and the
   Fens. Since Trudgill's investigations across East Anglia in the 1970s,
   however (e.g. Trudgill \& Foxcroft, 1978), and despite a few
   multilocality studies (Britain, 1991, 2014a; Potter, 2018) no research
   has been able to provide a picture of the state of the traditional
   dialectacross the whole region. We have therefore only a patchy
   understanding of the extent to which traditional dialect obsolescence,
   dialect levelling and innovation diffusion have impacted the dialect
   landscape of this region as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{A well-known example of variation in Early Modern English is found in
   the morphology of the third-person singular present tense indicative
   verb. In general terms there was a gradual shift from -th to -s (e.g.,
   pleaseth to pleases). However, previous studies such as Kyto (1993) and
   Nevalainen and Raumolin-Brunberg (2003) found that this shift was by no
   means uniform, varying by, for example, region, type of text, and
   author. More specifically, Nevalainen, Raumolin-Brunberg, and Trudgill
   (2001) analyzed the distribution of endings for the third-person
   singular present indicative verb in Early Modern East Anglian English,
   i.e., the variety of English used in the counties of Norfolk and
   Suffolk. However, for the final twenty-year period of their study
   (1660-1680), they only have four informants. This article analyzes the
   distribution of verb endings for a larger number of informants during
   this period, which marks the final stages of -th recession in East
   Anglian English, using letters written in Norfolk. The corpus based on
   these letters allows for a detailed analysis of linguistic and
   extralinguistic factors that influenced this distribution. Linguistic
   factors include the stem-final sound and verb-type (have, do, and say
   are analyzed separately). Among the extralinguistic factors analyzed are
   the sex of the author and addressee, the level of formality, and the
   author's social class. One of the informants in this study is Sir Thomas
   Browne. The distribution of verb endings in his correspondence makes him
   an outlier. His usage has led some authors to exclude his results from
   their analysis. The present article offers a new approach to dealing
   with such cases. The overall results are compared with those for other
   parts of England from the same period in order to identify patterns of
   regional variation. Finally, an analysis of correspondence for the
   period 1680-1750 indicates that by this time -th had more or less
   disappeared from Norfolk correspondence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes preliminary research on the role ain't for two
   groups of British speakers living in Suffolk: Anglos and Barbadians. The
   issues addressed are of relevance to sociolinguists and creolists. In
   most Anglophone countries, including Britain, the functions of ain't are
   remarkably similar - occurring with present tense verbs be and have
   only. An Anglophone pattern, based on previously reported tendencies and
   hierarchies is proposed and is used as the basis for comparison.
   Bajan(1) is one of the less often studied creoles and absent from work
   discussing their typological status in relation to L1s. Preliminary
   results provide some evidence of creole forms among first generation
   Bajans. Ethnically-aligned contrasts are also found for each generation
   as Bajans adopt the Anglophone pattern. The paper concludes that any
   interpretation of social and linguistic factors needs to be supplemented
   by further interactional analysis to account for the considerable
   inter-individual variation.}},

Abstract = {{The `Code-Muller protocols' (CMP) were introduced in 1983 and originally
   aimed to compare perceptions of psychosocial adjustment to aphasia and
   related disorders from the separate perspectives of patients, relatives
   and speech and language therapists as a basis for counselling. In later
   studies the items of the CMP were also used to examine perceptions of
   their importance as possible therapy targets in the rehabilitation of
   people with communication disorders. This paper describes the
   development of the CMP and presents an overview of their application in
   aphasia, laryngectomy and acquired deafness and discusses some clinical
   implications. Studies published in the past 15 years show that aphasic
   people and their relatives or significant others are significantly more
   optimistic concerning psychosocial adjustment than their therapists.
   Furthermore, optimism changes during the course of illness. The relative
   weightings given for therapy or rehabilitation targets significantly
   differ between different professional groups concerned with aphasia
   rehabilitation (speech and language therapists/pathologists,
   physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and physicians)
   and are influenced by clinical experience.}},
