Abstract = {{Three experiments examined temporal isolation effects (TIEs), the recall
   advantage for stimuli separated by increased inter-stimulus intervals.
   Prior research suggests that TIEs are observed in immediate free recall
   (IFR) using longer lists, but are weaker or absent in immediate serial
   recall (ISR) using shorter lists. Using digit-filled intervals to reduce
   rehearsal, IFR and ISR benefitted overall from longer pre-item intervals
   and shorter post-item intervals, using lists of 7, 17, and 5 words
   (Experiments 1-3, respectively). Consistent with a grouping account, the
   first words recalled were often preceded by longer pre-item intervals
   and transitions tended to be between neighboring items separated by
   shorter intervals. Using 7-item lists with unfilled intervals
   (Experiment 3), both IFR and ISR benefitted from longer post-item
   intervals (possibly due to rehearsal), and once the first responses were
   removed, there was no effect of pre-item interval on either task. These
   similar findings encourage the theoretical integration of ISR and IFR.}},

Title = {{Regional Variation in Early Modern English: The Case of the Third-Person
   Present Tense Singular Verb Ending in Norfolk Correspondence}},

Abstract = {{A well-known example of variation in Early Modern English is found in
   the morphology of the third-person singular present tense indicative
   verb. In general terms there was a gradual shift from -th to -s (e.g.,
   pleaseth to pleases). However, previous studies such as Kyto (1993) and
   Nevalainen and Raumolin-Brunberg (2003) found that this shift was by no
   means uniform, varying by, for example, region, type of text, and
   author. More specifically, Nevalainen, Raumolin-Brunberg, and Trudgill
   (2001) analyzed the distribution of endings for the third-person
   singular present indicative verb in Early Modern East Anglian English,
   i.e., the variety of English used in the counties of Norfolk and
   Suffolk. However, for the final twenty-year period of their study
   (1660-1680), they only have four informants. This article analyzes the
   distribution of verb endings for a larger number of informants during
   this period, which marks the final stages of -th recession in East
   Anglian English, using letters written in Norfolk. The corpus based on
   these letters allows for a detailed analysis of linguistic and
   extralinguistic factors that influenced this distribution. Linguistic
   factors include the stem-final sound and verb-type (have, do, and say
   are analyzed separately). Among the extralinguistic factors analyzed are
   the sex of the author and addressee, the level of formality, and the
   author's social class. One of the informants in this study is Sir Thomas
   Browne. The distribution of verb endings in his correspondence makes him
   an outlier. His usage has led some authors to exclude his results from
   their analysis. The present article offers a new approach to dealing
   with such cases. The overall results are compared with those for other
   parts of England from the same period in order to identify patterns of
   regional variation. Finally, an analysis of correspondence for the
   period 1680-1750 indicates that by this time -th had more or less
   disappeared from Norfolk correspondence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes preliminary research on the role ain't for two
   groups of British speakers living in Suffolk: Anglos and Barbadians. The
   issues addressed are of relevance to sociolinguists and creolists. In
   most Anglophone countries, including Britain, the functions of ain't are
   remarkably similar - occurring with present tense verbs be and have
   only. An Anglophone pattern, based on previously reported tendencies and
   hierarchies is proposed and is used as the basis for comparison.
   Bajan(1) is one of the less often studied creoles and absent from work
   discussing their typological status in relation to L1s. Preliminary
   results provide some evidence of creole forms among first generation
   Bajans. Ethnically-aligned contrasts are also found for each generation
   as Bajans adopt the Anglophone pattern. The paper concludes that any
   interpretation of social and linguistic factors needs to be supplemented
   by further interactional analysis to account for the considerable
   inter-individual variation.}},

Abstract = {{The `Code-Muller protocols' (CMP) were introduced in 1983 and originally
   aimed to compare perceptions of psychosocial adjustment to aphasia and
   related disorders from the separate perspectives of patients, relatives
   and speech and language therapists as a basis for counselling. In later
   studies the items of the CMP were also used to examine perceptions of
   their importance as possible therapy targets in the rehabilitation of
   people with communication disorders. This paper describes the
   development of the CMP and presents an overview of their application in
   aphasia, laryngectomy and acquired deafness and discusses some clinical
   implications. Studies published in the past 15 years show that aphasic
   people and their relatives or significant others are significantly more
   optimistic concerning psychosocial adjustment than their therapists.
   Furthermore, optimism changes during the course of illness. The relative
   weightings given for therapy or rehabilitation targets significantly
   differ between different professional groups concerned with aphasia
   rehabilitation (speech and language therapists/pathologists,
   physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and physicians)
   and are influenced by clinical experience.}},

   features apply regression to a series of successive cepstral vectors to
   generate differential cepstra, or apply a cosine transform to generate

   such that a series of stacked cepstral vectors is multiplied by a
   temporal transform matrix to produce the final speech feature. This can
   made to incorporate both static and dynamic speech information. Using
   this method, the coding of temporal information is not restricted to
   regression or cosine coefficients - any suitable transform may used.
   Results are presented for a variety of transforms, such as Legendre,
   Karhunen-Loeve, Cosine, Rectangle, where it is shown that the transform

   acknowledged weakness of the acoustic models for accurate temporal
   modeling of speech signals. Two forms of durational model are
   investigated: an expanded-state model and an explicit model. Both forms
   of model significantly reduce the number of insertion errors and hence
   the digit string error rate. A modification to the explicit model which
   also accounts for speaking rate is described.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a set of novel algorithms for the signal
   modification component of concatenative text-to-speech systems. The
   algorithms described here are based around the LPC analysis/synthesis
   framework, and achieve prosodic modification by rime-domain processing
   of the LPC residual. The modified residual is then recombined with the
   all-pole spectral estimate to synthesise the new speech signal.
   The methods differ in the processing applied to the residual signal. The
   first method uses a modified version of TD-PSOLA, relying on assumptions
   of decorrelation and spectral flatness to avoid spectral distortion, The
   second method uses multiple windowing within each pitch period, enabling
   a given pitch modification to be realised by shifting several windowed
   segments by small amounts rather than a large shift of a single window.
   Again the aim is to reduce phase distortion introduced by the
   time-shifting process. The third method is based on a smoothly varying
   resampling of the residual, rather than windowed overlap-add.
   TD-PSOLA and the residual-based methods were subject to informal
   listening tests both with pitch and rime-scaled natural speech, and also
   integrated into the signal processing stage of the BT Laureate
   text-to-speech system.}},

   Using conversational material from Suffolk English I show how two
   approaches can produce completely different results. The first approach
   is that outlined above; the second accounts for the phonetics of
   conversational material in its own terms, that is, without making
   reference to any citation-form phonetics. The second approach provides a
   unitary account of complex articulatory and phonatory activity that the
   first approach fails to relate at all.}},
