\section{Introduction}

Bias in science is unavoidable, and sociolinguistics is no different. In order to combat sources of bias, we must first identify its existence. With this study we aim to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assess whether there is bias towards studying some varieties of English over others.
\item Assess whether location in relation to a research institution affect frequency of study of a variety of English.
\item Assess other possible geographical/reseearch characteristics (e.g. the existence of corpora/average income of the area where the variety is spoken) that may affects the frequency of studies published.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

In order to meet our aims we:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Systematically searched for studies on each particular variety of native English as identified by Wikipedia.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Search Term: (WC=(Linguistics)  AND  ((ALL="name of variety")  AND  ((ALL=sociolinguist*)  OR  (ALL=varia*)  OR  (ALL=change))))
		\item Document Type: All
		\item Timespan: 1982-2019 
	\end{itemize}
%	\item Wikipedia was used as it serves as a kind of public self-identifier for speakers of speaking different varieties.
	\item The data from searches was pre-screened and removed if not relevant. Inclusion criteria:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the study assesses language variation or change
		\item Studies must be studying the appropriate variety of English
	\end{itemize}
	\item The remaining studies from each search were counted and the frequency of papers found per variety calculated.

\end{itemize}
