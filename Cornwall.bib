Abstract = {{Situated at the extreme south west periphery of the British Isles,
   Cornwall's territorial isolation bred cultural isolation which has been
   construed and reconstrued over time, giving Cornwall a distinctive
   cultural flavour. Initially borne out by facts of geography, Cornwall,
   or `Kernow', experiences a dynamic yet enduring peripheral existence
   (see Payton, 1992). This article explores how Anglo-Cornish dialect
   words can be used as a means of identity construction, that is, how a
   Cornish way of speaking is used to construct identities associated with
   a Cornish way of being. I hypothesise that those who desire greater
   Cornish autonomy are more likely to use Anglo-Cornish dialect lexis than
   those who favour further socio-cultural assimilation with England.}},

Abstract = {{In their article, Mougeon, Hallion, Bigot, and Papen attempt to explain
   the similarities and differences among four varieties of Canadian French
   spoken outside Quebec (and New Brunswick) in the use of the restriction
   forms rien que, juste, seulement (que), and ne ... que. Mougeon and
   colleagues focused on the French varieties spoken in Welland (Ontario),
   Saint-Boniface (Manitoba), Saint-Laurent (i.e., Mitchif French,
   Manitoba) and Bonnyville (Alberta) (see also Nadasdi \& Keppie 2004).
   Using a variationist sociolinguistic framework, they examined the effect
   of linguistic and extralinguistic factors on speakers' use of the
   aforementioned restriction forms, and compared their results to those
   reported in previous studies of the French varieties spoken in Montreal
   (Quebec) (Massicotte 1984, 1986; Thibault \& Daveluy 1989) and in
   Hawkesbury, Cornwall, Northbay, and Pembroke (Ontario) (Rehner \&
   Mougeon 1998). Based on their results, Mougeon and colleagues made
   hypotheses regarding linguistic convergence/divergence and raise
   relevant questions for future research. In this commentary, I briefly
   assess some of the contributions made by this research from a
   psycholinguistic perspective. In doing so, I raise additional questions
   concerning the source of the effects reported in the study.}},

Title = {{Framing English language teaching}},
Journal = {{SYSTEM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{163-175}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{English language teaching (ELT) can be characterized in different ways,
   considered as specific frames or framings. ELT work can be
   conceptualized as instruction, business, service, profession, and
   disciplinary field. ELT has further framings in terms of sociocultural
   context, including an internal framing determined by the types of people
   involved in ELT practice and an external framing by larger institutions
   and social structures. The latter type of sociocultural context
   incorporates an interactive dynamic of global and local forces impacting
   ELT and its sites of practice. Viewed through these diverse frames, ELT
   is revealed as a complex, hybrid enterprise incorporating rather
   different, sometimes conflicting, goals and priorities. The complex work
   of ELT and its many contextual factors require a balancing of priorities
   and innovation within an evolving social and educational ecology, and
   the multi-faceted and changing nature of ELT work can be examined
   through practice-based inquiry questions. The discussion addresses
   potential conflicts across the different facets of ELT work, issues of
   disciplinary positioning, and the academic status of ELT. It is argued
   that recognizing the types of expertise underlying the diverse frames of
   ELT can lead to a stronger positioning within higher education. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Heritage tourism commonly involves displays designed to represent and
   commemorate a valued cultural past. Our particular focus in this paper
   is mining heritage, and how it has been developed in Wales and Cornwall
   to reflect their rather different, but culturally and nationally
   defining, industrial histories. From some historical and critical
   perspectives, heritage is still a controversial concept involving
   simulation and commercialisation, which is often perceived as
   inauthentic. Yet heritage sites like Geevor in Cornwall and Big Pit in
   Wales, our two empirical foci, are promoted largely in terms of their
   authentic value. Visitors can experience the past', e.g. by going
   underground, being guided by real miners' and engaging with material
   artefacts of mining, not merely observe it. We draw on recent critical
   perspectives that move beyond essentialising conceptions of
   (in)authenticity, to analyse the competing claims to authenticity that
   we see in the promotional and interpretive discourses of mining
   heritage. We argue that, at the two sites, such discourses are organised
   within four frames, which we refer to as material, cultural,
   performative and recreational. Each frame defines a social dimension in
   which authenticity can be experienced. Together, the four frames provide
   a productive means of discursively managing the competing priorities
   that lie at the heart of heritage tourism.

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the uptake of standardized terminology and
   definitions for texture modified foods and fluids. The Australian
   dietetic and speech-language pathology associations endorsed national
   standards in 2007. This project sought to determine the barriers and
   enablers for use of the national standards in clinical practice.
   Cross-sectional online surveys were developed, including open- and
   closed-response questions. The surveys targeted different professional
   groups in Australia including speech-language pathologists, dietitians,
   nurses, and food service personnel. Australian accredited universities
   were contacted to determine penetration of the standards. A total of 574
   surveys were received. Sixty-five per cent of respondents indicated full
   implementation, 23\% partial implementation, and 10\% no implementation
   of the standards in their workplace. Speech-language pathologists and
   dietitians were most likely to have championed implementation of the
   standards. Barriers to implementation included: lack of knowledge about
   the standards, time, and resistance to change. Enablers included:
   encouragement to use the standards and `buy-in' from stakeholders.
   Benefits of implementation included: consistent terminology and
   perceived improvements in patient safety. It was concluded that the
   standards have been successfully implemented in a majority of facilities
   and Australian universities. This study provides insight into the
   complexity of introducing and managing change in healthcare
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The article re-evaluates the episode of the first encounter between
   Tristan and the courtly society of Cornwall as Gottfried von Strassburg
   describes it in his Tristan romance around the year 1210. Within a
   scenery that is dominated by all modern aspects of the courtly hunt,
   Tristan meets the members of Marke's court as they are about to dissect
   a stag they just caught. Earlier research on the episode has mostly
   argued that the young hero's demonstration of a rather complicated and
   complex way of dissecting the stag signifies the exceptional courtliness
   of Tristan who therefore is said to function as a founder of courtly
   manners for the society of Cornwall. However, the article at hand
   demonstrates that Gottfried's depiction of the hunt shows references to
   the Latin discourse on Court Criticism, established at the English court
   of Henry II. In his Policraticus - a prominent example of this discourse
   - John of Salisbury critically elaborates on the feudal delight in all
   concerns of the hunt. To him, this feudal desire for hunting endangers
   the hierarchical and ``natural{''} order of medieval society.
   Gottfried's depiction of the courtly society of Cornwall alludes to
   these critical remarks. His narration therefore is not only concerned
   with establishing an ideal of courtliness represented by Tristan, but is
   also concerned with describing how the court, driven by its desire for
   hunting, fails to acknowledge that the change of hunting practices
   Tristan brings about also fundamentally alters the order of Marke's
   court.}},
