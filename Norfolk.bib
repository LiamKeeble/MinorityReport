   nouns in disciplinary writing}},
Journal = {{LINGUA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{252}},
Number = {{SI}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The last 50 years have seen considerable changes in both research and
   publication practices in international English-medium arenas, and also
   witnessed a shift in argument styles in academic texts over these years
   (e.g. Hyland and Jiang, 2019). However, little attention was given to
   the rhetorical roles of nouns in diachronic studies of professional
   research writing. This is surprising since academic writing is an
   extremely noun-heavy register and novice writers often find nominal
   expressions difficult. In this study, we examine what are called
   metadiscursive nouns, a type of unspecific abstract nouns, in our
   diachronic corpus of disciplinary research writing to see whether they
   have increased in recent decades. It is found that this N pattern is
   most frequent overall, but hard scientists made increased use of quality
   nouns to promote the value of their research outcome while writers in
   the soft disciplines prefer evidential nouns for factual support to
   their knowledge claims. All these point to the need to include
   metadiscursive nouns into the rhetorical repertoire of metadiscourse and
   to emphasise their functions in the course of using English for research
   and publication purposes. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Exploring an elementary ESL teacher's emotions and advocacy identity}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL MULTILINGUAL RESEARCH JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Scholars, activists, and communities strive for educational equity and
   justice for emergent bilinguals. The pursuit of advocacy, however, is
   often fraught with emotional tension, leading many teachers to question
   their identities as advocates. Relatively few studies have focused on
   language teachers of color, and on how they navigate their emotions as
   they construct their identity as advocates - even though teachers of
   color are disproportionately called upon to act as advocates. By drawing
   attention to discursive and emotional aspects of identity positionings
   related to raciolinguistic ideologies, this study shows how one Latinx
   teacher's emotions shaped her identity as an advocate in support of
   emergent bilinguals. The participant, an experienced elementary ESL
   teacher, constructed her identity as an advocate in her striving to
   address issues of equity and social justice during a period of shifting
   language policy in Massachusetts. The analysis reveals that she
   variously adopted, appropriated, or resisted normative discourses around
   advocating for emergent bilinguals and power relations over her career,
   and over the changing education policy context. This study is a step
   toward giving minoritized language teachers greater institutional
   support in their pursuit of advocacy work, by focusing on their emotions
   and identities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a bibliometric analysis to track changes in EAP research
   over the last 40 years. Based on a corpus of 12,600 EAP-related articles
   from 40 Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals, we reveal what
   research topics have been most popular over time and which authors,
   publications and source countries have been most influential. The
   results show that while topics concerning teaching, learning and
   classroom practices, have remained popular, those with a focus on
   contexts and discourses have grown since 2001, with substantial
   attention devoted to identity, interaction and genre. The most cited
   authors and publications also show a marked shift towards an interest in
   academic writing, language description and perspectives underpinning
   social relationships in learning and communication. Finally, our study
   shows that EAP is achieving a global reach as authors affiliated with
   emerging centres of research, particularly China, begin to make a mark
   on the field. We believe these findings may be of interest to EAP
   professionals seeking to become more familiar with the field and as a
   way of mapping the emergence of EAP as a maturing discipline. (C) 2020

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{231-244}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The concept of ``Discernment politeness{''} stems from research
   undertaken in the 1980s on the Japanese phenomenon of wakimae. Since the
   earliest work on the phenomenon by Hill et al. (1986) and Ide (1989,
   1992), many scholars have looked to further explore Discernment across
   cultures (i.e. Kadar and Mills, 2013; Kadar and Paternoster, 2015;
   Ridealgh and Jucker, 2019). Fundamentally, Discernment has been
   approached as expected (and quasi-mandatory) behavioural norms used by
   subordinates towards their superiors within a communicative act,
   dictated by the socio-cultural context of the interaction (Ridealgh and
   Jucker, 2019). What becomes apparent, when studying ancient languages,
   is that due to the hierarchical nature of remote societies, Discernment
   includes a complementary dimension, an opposing phenomenon to deference,
   equally visible in interpersonal interactions, which has its foundation
   within the Power variable. This paper explores this opposing phenomenon
   (i.e. expected or permitted language used by superiors to their
   subordinates as a manifestation of their Power), which we call
   ``Potestas{''}, within the context of Late Egyptian and Old Latin, in
   order to highlight the phenomenon, its forms of expression in these two
   languages, the gaps in regards to the Power variable within traditional
   politeness approaches, and its relationship with (Im)politeness

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Metadiscourse is now established as one of the most frequently used
   methods for analysing academic discourse, but one feature, frame
   markers, seem to have gone relatively unnoticed. Frame markers represent
   an important way by which authors structure their discourse for
   particular readers, helping them to see the coherence of arguments and
   guiding their thinking in the direction the author wishes to go. As a
   result, like all metadiscourse, it varies with audience, purpose and
   context and in this paper we explore this variation by studying how
   authors use this feature when reworking their research articles as
   academic blogs. Based on two corpora of 50 blog posts and 50 journal
   articles with the same authors and topics, we found important
   differences in the use of frame markers and in the distribution and
   frequencies of its sub-categories. The results show how writers are
   sensitive to reader knowledge and the kinds of assistance that expert
   and lay audiences may need in order to follow the author's arguments.
   The study thus contributes to our understanding of how writers' choices
   help define different rhetorical contexts and the ways that
   recontextualisation is accomplished across academic genres. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{One of the key-metaphor complexes in conceptualizing national identity
   is that of the nation as a body or a person, especially in
   English-speaking cultures, as evidenced in the lexicalization of phrases
   such as body politic, head of state). It has a long conceptual history
   and still figures prominently in present-day political discourse, both
   in Inner Circle English-speaking countries and internationally. It thus
   seems to show considerable semantic stability; however, it is still an
   open question whether the use of body-or person-based metaphors in
   international English means that recipients in different cultures
   understand these metaphors uniformly. This paper discusses empirical
   evidence from an international interpretation survey that shows
   substantial variation in conceptualization of the nation as a body, with
   five main conceptual scenarios (nation as body, nation's territory as
   body, nation as body part, nation as part of ego and nation as person).}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conversation Partner schemes are increasingly used as a way
   of addressing the psychosocial and emotional consequences of aphasia,
   providing opportunities for people with aphasia to engage in authentic
   conversation and to develop social relationships. As yet, there are no
   outcome measures, that are theorised to match what is expected to change
   and how such changes are best identified, and that specifically address
   the constructs of Conversation Partner schemes. Aims: This study aimed
   to develop a new, theoretically motivated and accessible
   patient-reported outcome measure for evaluating the experiences of
   people with aphasia involved in Conversation Partner schemes, and for
   assessing the impact of schemes on areas of importance to people with
   aphasia. Methods \& procedures: A mixed-methods study was undertaken in
   two phases. Phase 1 (item generation) used semi-structured one-to-one
   interviews and focus groups, which were subject to thematic analysis;
   Nominal Group Technique was used to develop and refine the item pool. In
   Phase 2 cognitive interviews were used to examine content validity;
   structural validity was examined using statistical methods (exploratory
   factor analysis; Rasch model analysis). Outcomes \& results: Six themes
   from interviews and focus groups were developed into 41 candidate items
   through Nominal Group Technique. Item reduction through cognitive
   interviewing produced a 30-item scale, which was piloted and then
   field-tested by 123 community-dwelling adults with aphasia; 121
   responses were subject to exploratory factor analysis and further item
   reduction, producing a four factor, 14-item scale. Rasch analysis
   demonstrated overall fit to the Rasch model and excellent targeting of
   items to person. Creation of 3 testlets by grouping items together
   accommodated the dependence found between pairs of items. Conclusions:
   The Conversation and Communication Questionnaire for people with Aphasia
   V3 is a 14-item, patient-reported measure for use with patients with
   aphasia taking part in Conversation Partner schemes. It is concise, has
   strong content validity, and has some supporting evidence of construct
   validity. Further research is needed to test its reliability and
   responsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The byzantine conventions of advanced academic writing in English are
   notoriously difficult for graduate students and junior scholars to gain
   control over. Global higher education and academic publishing have seen
   a massive expansion in recent years, so that the ability to demonstrate
   insider disciplinary competence and a grasp of scholarly persuasion has
   become essential for academic success. With courses in English for
   Research and Publication Purposes (ERPP) in their infancy and unknown in
   many countries, writers often turn to the advice of style manuals for
   guidance. Here they often find recommendations to follow general
   principles of clarity, brevity and objectivity and are given advice on
   specific features to achieve this. In this paper we examine three of the
   most commonly referred to features: demonstrative `this', existential
   `there' and first-person pronouns. With the aid of a diachronic corpus
   of articles from four disciplines over the past 50 years, we find that
   expert use of these features has increasingly departed from the advice
   in the guides. We describe how the use of these features has changed and
   stress what instructors in ERPP courses might teach.}},

Abstract = {{Can a proverb be quoted against itself? Since its introduction into the
   British ``Brexit{''} debate in early 2016, the proverbial notion of
   ``having one's cake and eat it{''} has had its meaning temporarily
   turned upside down from exposing the absurdity of wishing to consume and
   still retain the same goods or privileges, to serve as a reassuring
   promise (i.e., that in withdrawing from the EU, the UK could hold on to
   all or most of the membership benefits whilst shedding its obligations,
   which would equal `having one's cake and eating it').
   Using a corpus of 180 + British media texts containing varying
   applications of the proverb, this article charts its pragmatic
   development 2016-19 and discusses the conditions of its change from an
   ironical condemnation into a reassuring promise (and back). We identify
   a metaphorical scenario with strongly implicated evaluations as a
   necessary condition for the interpretability of the proverb's
   metarepresentations and analyse the emergence of competing scenario
   versions with reference to an iteration of ironical metarepresentations,
   which leads to a `layering' of metarepresentations. In conclusion, we
   propose to include discourse-historical knowledge in the notion of
   metarepresentation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{155}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the locally situated interactional
   functions of so-called epistemic modals, daroo and deshoo, in Japanese
   conversation. Although the two forms are generally considered plain and
   polite variants of the same epistemic modal, both forms frequently
   appear in the present casual conversational data. A detailed sequential
   analysis demonstrates that daroo and deshoo are used to perform various
   social actions rather than simply expressing the speaker's conjecture.
   Deshoo has a rather fixed function of soliciting alignment or
   confirmation from the interlocutor. On the other hand, daroo works as
   part of larger constructions for various actions, including (i)
   displaying spontaneity, (ii) expressing neutral or uninvolved stance,
   (iii) displaying alignment, (iv) qualifying one's assertion, and (v)
   challenging the interlocutor's assertion. The findings suggest that
   linguistic categories such as `epistemic modals' are epiphenomena of
   social interaction (Ford et al., 2013), which are not themselves
   interactionally relevant to the conversational participants. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Experience through sight has been recognized as a contributing factor in
   the shaping of historic landscapes, where humans could express
   themselves in response to their aesthetic and intellectual qualities.
   What was experienced, however, was not only dependent on the `prospect',
   or landscape view, but also on the individual `perspective' of the
   spectator. Three-dimensional Geographical Information Systems (3D GIS)
   has enabled investigations into landscape visibility within digitized
   historic environments and can therefore assist the analysis and
   understanding of this phenomenon. This article applies 3D GIS to a
   currently under-researched area of landscape history, English designed
   landscapes of the 16th and 17th centuries. From country houses and
   gardens to parks and working estates, these landscapes were manipulated
   in response to the landowners' `perspectives' towards the landscape,
   which subsequently determined the visibility or invisibility of features
   within certain `prospects'. This concept was dubbed `The Royaltie of
   Sight' by Henry Wotton in 1624. By using 3D GIS to recreate a designed
   landscape that poses challenges which have previously hindered its
   analysis, the characteristics of `prospects' can be ascertained using
   viewshed analysis and the individual `perspective' of the landowner
   interpreted using phenomenology and reception theory. The results
   presented in this article demonstrate how 3D GIS has benefited studies
   into English designed landscapes and improved knowledge of how
   perception influenced landscape change.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectives/purpose/research question: We propose a model that
   captures general patterns in bilingual language processing, based on
   empirical evidence elicited in a variety of experimental studies. We
   begin by considering what linguistic outputs are logically possible when
   bilingual speakers communicate based on the typological features of two
   languages in the bilingual mind. Our aim is to explain why some outputs
   are more frequent or more likely than others in bilingual language use.
   Design/methodology/approach: Our empirically derived multi-factor model
   combines insights from various empirical studies of different bilingual
   populations and it includes a variety of methodologies and approaches,
   such as lexical categorisation, lexical priming, syntactic priming,
   event verbalisation and memory, historical language change,
   grammaticality judgments and observational reports. Data and analysis:
   We critically discuss both lexical and syntactic processing data, as
   well as data that reflect bilingual type differences and different
   communicative situations (i.e. who the bilingual speakers are talking to
   and for what purpose). Crucially, we explain when the relevant factors
   collaborate and when they compete. Originality: There are three main
   reasons why this paper can be deemed original: 1) it offers a unified
   model for understanding bilingual language processing that is not
   focused on a single factor or a single linguistic level, as has most
   often been the case in the past; 2) it brings together the study of
   bilingualism from both psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives
   and in a unifying fashion, which is rare in the literature; and 3) it
   creates a platform for testing numerous predictions that are not
   dependent on any one theory.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the cross-linguistic exploitations of
   Lakoff?s ?STRICT FATHER? and ?NURTURING PARENT? frames. The British,
   American, Spanish, and French languages show significant variations of
   meaning of the metaphorical expression ?Mother Earth/Nature? used in
   press articles discussing climate change. The shift from conceptual
   metaphor theory to metaphor scenarios operated in this research reveals
   major adjustments to Lakoff?s findings with, notably, the identification
   of a ?STRICT MOTHER? in our corpus. The cross-linguistic perspective
   also emphasizes socio-cultural influence on the metaphorical
   interpretation and the related metaphorical frames. For instance, our
   results highlight linguistic evidences of language-specific and
   culture-specific characterizations of the ?MOTHER?. The reliance on
   ?RELIGION? metaphors in climate change discourses has been previously
   documented by researchers. However, we demonstrate that the reliance on
   myths has a significant role to play in the characterization of the
   ?MOTHER? in different languages. The association between the myths and
   the frames related to the figure of the ?MOTHER? also influences the
   understanding of the topic of climate change fulfilling different
   argumentative stances.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Speech and language therapy (SLT) benefits people with
   aphasia following stroke. Group level summary statistics from randomised
   controlled trials hinder exploration of highly complex SLT interventions
   and a clinically relevant heterogeneous population. Creating a database
   of individual participant data (IPD) for people with aphasia aims to
   allow exploration of individual and therapy-related predictors of
   recovery and prognosis. Aim: To explore the contribution that individual
   participant characteristics (including stroke and aphasia profiles) and
   SLT intervention components make to language recovery following stroke.
   Methods and procedures: We will identify eligible IPD datasets
   (including randomised controlled trials, non-randomised comparison
   studies, observational studies and registries) and invite their
   contribution to the database. Where possible, we will use meta- and
   network meta-analysis to explore language performance after stroke and
   predictors of recovery as it relates to participants who had no SLT,
   historical SLT or SLT in the primary research study. We will also
   examine the components of effective SLT interventions. Outcomes and
   results: Outcomes include changes in measures of functional
   communication, overall severity of language impairment, auditory
   comprehension, spoken language (including naming), reading and writing
   from baseline. Data captured on assessment tools will be collated and
   transformed to a standardised measure for each of the outcome domains.
   Conclusion: Our planned systematic-review-based IPD meta- and network
   meta-analysis is a large scale, international, multidisciplinary and
   methodologically complex endeavour. It will enable hypotheses to be
   generated and tested to optimise and inform development of interventions
   for people with aphasia after stroke. Systematic review registration:
   The protocol has been registered at the International Prospective
   Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number:
   CRD42018110947)}},

Journal = {{ANGLIA-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ENGLISCHE PHILOLOGIE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In 2017 two objects carrying runic inscriptions that are identifiable as
   personal names were found. Both date to the ninth century; both are
   dithematic (compound) names. The object identified as a spoon or fork
   handle from Sedgeford in Norfolk bears a familiar male name, Biarnfero.
   This contains a runic graph hitherto unseen, which may, despite the
   provenance of the find, be interpreted as a representation of the
   diphthong ia that developed in the Kentish dialect by the middle of the
   ninth century. There is in fact a historically known individual of this
   name who witnessed a series of Canterbury charters in the mid-ninth
   century. The other object, a strap-end from Elsted in West Sussex,
   carries what can be identified from its final element, -flaed, as a
   female name, although the whole name cannot be read. What is legible
   cannot be identified with any previously recorded personal name.
   Evaluation of these finds emphasizes how Anglo-Saxon runic writing
   practice continued to adapt to changes in the language and the
   regularization of roman-script literacy in the ninth century. Finally,
   the role of literacy within a nexus of cultural relationship involving
   individuals and artefacts is also highlighted.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{536-549}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This is a report of the data from a current survey of academic
   programs in the United States, which provide preservice training in
   augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) for speech-language
   pathologists in the United States. A comparison of these findings to the
   last reported survey was made to identify changes and areas in need of
   further improvement following implementation of the recent changes to
   the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association Certification Standards
   of Clinical Practice.
   Method: A survey was distributed to 279 speech-language pathology
   graduate training programs in the United States identified from the
   Council on Academic Accreditation program list.
   Results: A total of 79 survey responses were received for a 28.4\%
   response rate. There was a statistically significant increase in the
   percentage of programs reported to provide at least 1 course with
   primary content in AAC compared to the last survey performed. The
   reported inclusion of MC content in other courses has also increased,
   and several programs report multiple AAC courses are now offered for
   specialized training. The majority of the programs report that less than
   half of the students graduate with clinical hours in AAC. The number of
   training grants and doctoral training remains limited to a few programs.
   Conclusion: Academic programs have increased the preservice training in
   AAC over the past decade. Data indicate a critical need for clinical
   experience and doctoral training to meet the growing demands of
   speech-language pathologists.}},

   politeness in remote cultures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{56-66}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The term ``Discernment{''} was originally coined back in the 1980s,
   where it was first used as an approximate translation of the Japanese
   term wakimae but later used independently in other contexts and
   cultures. In this paper, we re-assess its value as an analytical tool
   for two remote cultures and languages with a severely fragmented and
   limited textual heritage; Late Egyptian and Old English. In spite of
   their obvious differences, they have in common that their societies were
   strictly hierarchically ordered. Power was a fixed factor and not
   negotiable, and thus social movement was generally not possible. Our
   argumentation is based on a careful study of the Late Ramesside Letters,
   a corpus of personal communication written in Late Egyptian (c.
   1099-1069BCE), and on a range of different constructions (directives,
   terms of address) in Old English. In these contexts, the concept of
   Discernment turns out to be a very useful analytical tool to describe
   the relationship dynamics in strictly hierarchical societies. It
   describes (linguistic) behaviour which is socially and situationally
   adequate and quasi mandatory, and which closely indexes the social
   relationship between speaker and addressee, as well as the social and
   linguistic context within which the exchange takes place. (C) 2019

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Sociolinguists have adopted the concept of `super-diversity' from
   cultural anthropology to analyse multidimensional changes in
   ethnolinguistic identities resulting from recent mass migration.
   Sociolinguistic super-diversity is thus understood as a central aspect
   of shifts in migration patterns that have increased the complexity of
   cultural identities beyond traditional, more static `multicultural'
   diversity, both in Britain and globally. How is the presence of more
   complex and diverse linguistic identities viewed by the public? This
   paper explores attitudes towards perceived increased multilingualism and
   multiculturalism expressed in the BBC's Have Your Say Internet forum.
   The majority of postings blame immigrants for communication problems
   with the British `home' community and allege their unwillingness to
   learn English; many also assume that (only) a monolingual national
   community guarantees social coherence and they are dismissive of any
   language mediation services. In view of these `folk-sociolinguistic'
   assumptions and linguaphobic attitudes, the notion of super-diversity
   needs to be reconfigured so as to include the (unintended) adverse
   impact of the migration-induced increase in the diversity and complexity
   of imagined ethno-linguistic identities.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we explore the ways in which academic citation practices

   in 1965, 1985, and 2015, we document a substantial rise in citations
   over the period, particularly in applied linguistics and sociology. This
   is partly because there is now so much more research to report and that
   recognizing previous work is much easier as a result of electronic
   access and hyperlinks to sources. But citation is also increasingly
   required as a means of appropriately embedding research more securely in
   disciplinary understandings. Our results also show a fall in the use of
   reporting structures, a growing preference for non-integral forms, for
   research verbs, for the present tense, and for non-evaluative structures
   when reporting others' research. While patterns differ by discipline,
   there is a general trend towards writers suppressing human agency in
   knowledge-making and emphasizing the reported studies rather than those
   who conducted them to show how earlier research supports their own.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand writing teachers' language ideologies and how they
   might challenge or support the implementation of Student's Right to

   particular, I investigated how the instructor negotiates multiple
   language ideologies, including standard language ideology as well as
   more critical beliefs regarding language, to voice an
   appropriateness-based stance toward language variation. Such a stance
   views linguistic codes as appropriate in certain contexts and
   inappropriate, or unsuitable, in others. By voicing an
   appropriateness-based stance before and after her participation in
   professional development workshops designed to further develop
   instructors' critical language awareness, the instructor illustrates the
   complexity of enacting the tenets of SRTOL, even after engaging in
   reflexive analysis of her own language beliefs. To conclude, I suggest
   that the development of critical language awareness necessitates
   continual challenge and support if SRTOL is to move from theory to
   praxis in education. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PRAGMATICS AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-31}},
Abstract = {{In this paper I discuss the many complexities that police officers have
   to deal with in their communication with suspects. Investigative
   interviewing is a very complex communicative situation in itself, with a
   number of different psychological and sociological variables at play
   during each interview. In addition, suspect interviews bring about an
   additional dimension of complexity, which is driven by the fact that a
   basic principle of conversation, cooperation (Grice 1975) is often not
   respected and is sometimes severely and purposefully violated, for
   example when suspects are guilty and want to obscure that very fact or
   when they believe that their situation would worsen if they cooperated
   with the police. A further layer of complexity is added when the
   interviews are carried out via an interpreter, where the fact that the
   officer and the suspect speak different languages during the interview
   creates additional barriers to straightforward communication.
   In the present paper, I identify a number of points at which
   communication difficulties are encountered in this highly sensitive
   legal context. For this purpose, I analyse authentic interview datasets
   provided by two UK police constabularies, and also make comparisons with
   examples from transcripts of authentic US police interrogations. In
   addition, I highlight the issues that arise when professional
   interpretation is not available and when bilingual police officers
   assume the dual role of investigator-interpreter. Finally, I suggest
   possible solutions that can help remove the hurdles standing in the way
   of efficient and accurate gathering of communication evidence.}},

   the basis of a corpus of British political discourse and a questionnaire
   survey of more than 1000 respondents from 31 linguistic backgrounds in
   10 countries. The corpus-based evidence consists of metaphor-production
   data that show how situational variation in metaphor use can over time
   create a semantic-pragmatic drift that changes the dominant meaning of a
   conventional metaphor expression. The questionnaire survey reveals four
   distinct models for BODY-focused readings (i.e. NATION AS GEOBODY, AS
   HIERARCHICAL FUNCTIONAL WHOLE, AS PART OF SPEAKER'S BODY, AS PART OF
   LARGER BODY), plus a further set PERSON-focused readings. The two most
   frequent BODY-focused interpretations, i.e. NATION AS GEOBODY and NATION
   AS HIERARCHICAL FUNCTIONAL WHOLE, as well as the PERSON-stereotypes
   versions show divergent frequency and elaboration patterns across the
   Chinese-vs. English-L1 respondent groups, which may be linked to

Abstract = {{Research on feedback in second language writing has grown enormously in
   the past 20 years and has expanded to include studies comparing human
   raters and automated writing evaluation (AWE) programmes. However, we
   know little about the ways students engage with these different sources
   of feedback or their relative impact on writing over time. This
   naturalistic case study addresses this gap, looking at how two Chinese
   students of English engage with both teacher and AWE feedback on their
   writing over a 16-week semester. Drawing on student texts, teacher
   feedback, AWE feedback, and student interviews, we identify the
   strengths and weaknesses of both types of feedback and show how
   engagement is a crucial mediating variable in the use students make of
   feedback and the impact it has on their writing development. We argue
   that engagement is a key factor in the success of formative assessment
   in teaching contexts where multiple drafting is employed. Our results
   show that different sources of formative assessment have great potential
   in facilitating student involvement in writing tasks and we highlight
   some of these pedagogical implications for promoting student engagement
   with teacher and AWE feedback.}},

Abstract = {{An important component of fluent linguistic production and a key

   extensively, particularly in academic writing in English, but little is

   explore changes in their use and frequency over the past 50 years,
   drawing on a corpus of 2.2 million words taken from top research

Title = {{Reporting interventions in communication partner training: a critical
   review and narrative synthesis of the literature}},
Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{1135-1166}},
Abstract = {{Background: Communication partner training (CPT) is an umbrella term for
   a complex behavioural intervention for communications partners (CPs) of
   people with aphasia (PWA) and possibly PWA themselves, with many
   interacting components, deployed in flexible ways. Recent systematic
   reviews (Simmons-Mackie, Raymer, Armstrong, Holland, \& Cherney, 2010;
   Simmons-Mackie, Raymer, \& Cherney, 2016) have highlighted the
   effectiveness of CPT in addressing the skills of conversation partners
   and the communicative participation of people with aphasia but have
   suggested that CPT has been variably delivered, with no clear picture of
   what the essential elements of CPT are and how CPT is expected to
   achieve its results through hypothesised mechanisms of change (Coster,
   2013).
   Aim: This paper aims broadly to consider specification of CPT and
   describes how CPT has been conducted overall and in relation to
   treatment recipients. Recommendations for CPT and areas for future
   research are considered.
   Methods \& Procedures: A critical review and narrative synthesis was
   carried out through: (i) the systematic application of the 12item TIDieR
   checklist (Hoffmann et al., 2014) to the 56 studies appraised in the
   Simmons-Mackie et al. (2010, 2016)) reviews, providing a quantitative
   overview of the completeness of CPT intervention reporting; and (ii) a
   qualitative synthesis of the reviewed CPT literature according to TIDieR
   items.
   Outcomes \& Results: Half of the TIDieR checklist items were reported by
   71\% or more of the studies, and the rest of the items were reported by
   0-63\% of studies. TIDieR items relating to the treatment (goal,
   rationale or theory of essential elements, materials and procedures) and
   provision (provider, mode, timing, dose) were more frequently reported;
   however, the level of detail provided was often inadequate or
   incomplete. The interventions were insufficiently specified to enable
   replication for most of the studies considered. The most infrequently
   reported items were: name, location, intervention tailoring and
   modification, and planned and actual intervention adherence/fidelity.
   Conclusion: For a better understanding of an intervention, it is
   necessary to identify and describe potentially central elements and
   perhaps especially in complex interventions as CPT, where it is likely
   also more difficult. Whilst the reviewed CPT studies are on average
   reporting on slightly more than half of the TIDieR items, they are
   overall insufficiently detailed. Some items appear easier to report on,
   whereas other items have not been attended to, are too complex in nature
   to give a full report on, or simply have not been relevant for the
   individual study to include}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores changes in the use of an important pattern used by

   evaluation of the proposition which follows. Linguists have tended to
   regard this as separate patterns, but seeing it as a single structure of
   a matrix clause {[}evaluation] + that clause {[}evaluated entity]
   enables us to recognize a single evaluative purpose with a variety of
   rhetorical options for writers. Here we examine the contribution of this
   explicit that pattern to the key genre of the academy, the research
   article, and map changes in its use and frequency over the past 50

Pages = {{77-89}},
Abstract = {{This paper contributes to research on media representations of care with
   a textual analysis of BBC children's television. As a public service
   broadcaster, the BBC is tasked with the fostering and sustaining of
   citizenship. This paper argues that representations of care are an
   important way by which the BBC can potentially meet its remit and inform
   children's perceptions of informal care. It takes a focused look at the
   portrayal of grandparent-grandchild relationships of care in three
   programmes: Mr Alzheimer's and Me, Katie Morag and Topsy and Tim. All
   three programmes show narrative moments which map onto Tronto's concept
   of good care, including attentiveness, responsibility, competence,
   responsiveness, solidarity and trust. Grandparents and grandchildren are
   shown to be caring for each other. However, programmes do not challenge
   the inequalities which continue to structure the realities of informal
   care work. Neither the inequalities of power between carers and care
   receivers, nor the lack of public and government support for carers is
   addressed, and adult informal care is gendered. This paper argues that
   while BBC children's programmes provide important opportunities for
   children to learn the meaning of good care, in order for it to meet its
   public service remit, it should also provide opportunities to learn
   about the relationships of power that structure informal care.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{338-366}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A well-known example of variation in Early Modern English is found in
   the morphology of the third-person singular present tense indicative
   verb. In general terms there was a gradual shift from -th to -s (e.g.,
   pleaseth to pleases). However, previous studies such as Kyto (1993) and
   Nevalainen and Raumolin-Brunberg (2003) found that this shift was by no
   means uniform, varying by, for example, region, type of text, and
   author. More specifically, Nevalainen, Raumolin-Brunberg, and Trudgill
   (2001) analyzed the distribution of endings for the third-person
   singular present indicative verb in Early Modern East Anglian English,
   i.e., the variety of English used in the counties of Norfolk and
   Suffolk. However, for the final twenty-year period of their study
   (1660-1680), they only have four informants. This article analyzes the
   distribution of verb endings for a larger number of informants during
   this period, which marks the final stages of -th recession in East
   Anglian English, using letters written in Norfolk. The corpus based on
   these letters allows for a detailed analysis of linguistic and
   extralinguistic factors that influenced this distribution. Linguistic
   factors include the stem-final sound and verb-type (have, do, and say
   are analyzed separately). Among the extralinguistic factors analyzed are
   the sex of the author and addressee, the level of formality, and the
   author's social class. One of the informants in this study is Sir Thomas
   Browne. The distribution of verb endings in his correspondence makes him
   an outlier. His usage has led some authors to exclude his results from
   their analysis. The present article offers a new approach to dealing
   with such cases. The overall results are compared with those for other
   parts of England from the same period in order to identify patterns of
   regional variation. Finally, an analysis of correspondence for the
   period 1680-1750 indicates that by this time -th had more or less
   disappeared from Norfolk correspondence.}},

Abstract = {{In public political discourse, figurative expressions used by one

   Using data from a corpus documenting 25 years of debate in Britain about
   the nation's place at the heart of Europe, this paper investigates the
   interplay of metaphor, irony and sarcasm in public discourse. We show
   that the `discourse career' of this metaphorical slogan bifurcates into
   two strands, i.e. an affirmative, optimistic use vs deriding and
   ridiculing uses that depict the heart of Europe as diseased, dead,
   non-existent or rotten. It is argued that discourse participants need to
   retain the optimistic template version as a reference point in discourse
   memory to achieve the intended ironical and/or sarcastic effects, and
   that the latter are essential to keep the metaphoricity of the slogan

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The study examined three categories of multi-word verbs (phrasal,

   combinations. It explored four aspects of their usage in student
   presentations their frequency, the preferred order and meanings the
   presenters favored, their choices of unique vs. repeated uses of verb
   combinations, and the relationship between the lexical diversity of the
   presentations and students' use of multi-word verbs. The research is
   based on the individual presentations of English native speaking college
   students (n = 30).
   The analysis revealed that students used multi-word verbs as frequently
   as they did free combinations. It also showed that prepositional verbs
   were twice more prominent than phrasal verbs, followed by the relatively
   infrequent use of phrasal prepositional verbs. The students tended to
   use the multi-word verb structures repetitively and the lack of strong
   correlations between the lexical diversity of the presentations and the
   three multi-word verb subcategories pointed to the relative independence
   of the variables. The semantic analysis of the phrasal verbs revealed
   that, even though the majority of them had multiple meanings, they were
   predominantly used with a single meaning in the presentations. The
   findings have implications for ESL teaching and material design

Pages = {{27-34}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Limited research has been published regarding the association
   between stuttering and substance use. An earlier study provided no
   evidence for such an association, but the authors called for further
   research to be conducted using a community sample. The present study
   used data from a community sample to investigate whether an association
   between stuttering and alcohol consumption or regular smoking exists in
   late adolescence and adulthood.
   Methods: Regression analyses were carried out on data from a birth
   cohort study, the National Child Development Study (NCDS), whose initial
   cohort included 18,558 participants who have since been followed up
   until age 55. In the analyses, the main predictor variable was
   parent-reported stuttering at age 16. Parental socio-economic group,
   cohort member's sex and childhood behavioural problems were also
   included. The outcome variables related to alcohol consumption and
   smoking habits at ages 16, 23, 33, 41, 46, 50 and 55.
   Results: No significant association was found between stuttering and
   alcohol consumption or stuttering and smoking at any of the ages. It was
   speculated that the absence of significant associations might be due to
   avoidance of social situations on the part of many of the participants
   who stutter, or adoption of alternative coping strategies.
   Conclusion: Because of the association between anxiety and substance
   use, individuals who stutter and are anxious might be found to drink or
   smoke excessively, but as a group, people who stutter are not more
   likely than those who do not to have high levels of consumption of
   alcohol or nicotine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{181-201}},
Abstract = {{While it is not surprising that English would influence certain domains
   such as international trade, information technology, and academia, to
   name a few, the impact of English on non-domain specific elements
   remains less vigorously studied. In Italian, for instance, an increase
   in the use of present progressive constructions in dubbed products has
   been reported by a number of authors (i.e. Ferro \& Sardo 2008) who have
   also hypothesised that such an increase may have passed into real use
   Italian and that it may be due to the influence from English during the
   translation process. In consideration of the fact that in Italian the
   progressive form is not obligatory and that there are limitations on the
   possible semantic and morphosyntactic combinations, a general low
   frequency is expected. However, in this study, the diachronic
   quantitative investigations from written and spoken data of real use
   Italian have revealed that, from the Unification of Italy (1861) to
   2011, the frequency of use of such a construction has more than
   quadrupled in writing and that, from 1965 to 2004, has more than tripled
   in speech. The paper also explores the hypothesis that such a phenomenon
   may go beyond a mere frequency increase; our data show that the process
   may be so deep that it has affected formulaic expressions such as
   scherzi? {[}do you joke?] `are you joking?', which traditionally existed
   only at the simple form, by generating a progressive variant (e.g. stai
   scherzando?). The preliminary findings from the diachronic
   investigations also show plausible correlations with an English
   influence via dubbing.}},

Pages = {{205-224}},
Abstract = {{The distinction between `deliberate' and `non deliberate' metaphors has
   been developed within a five-step framework (Steen) of metaphor
   production. Deliberate metaphors invite the addressee to pay special
   attention to their cross-domain structure mapping rather than focusing
   primarily on the topical proposition. This paper presents results of a
   pilot survey eliciting interpretations for the metaphors a nation is a
   body/a nation is a person from an international sample of respondents in
   10 different countries. ESL/EFL users from diverse cultural and/or
   linguistic backgrounds were asked to apply the metaphorical idiom body
   politic to their home nations. The responses show systematic variation
   in preferred metaphor interpretations, some of which can be linked to
   dominant cultural traditions, as well as evidence of polemical and/or
   ironic elaboration. Neither of these findings is predicted by classic
   conceptualist models that describe metaphor understanding as an
   automatic and unconscious process. Instead, when paying special
   attention to metaphoricity, informants seem to have chosen between
   diverse interpretation versions and in some cases to have elaborated
   them further to achieve social pragmatic effects. These findings provide
   new supporting evidence for Deliberate Metaphor Theory by highlighting
   deliberateness in metaphor interpretation and outlining perspectives for
   further empirical testing of metaphor understanding in specific
   registers and usage contexts (e.g., political discourse, EFL/ESL
   acquisition).}},

Title = {{Development of Trivia Game for speech understanding in background noise}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{357-366}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Listening in noise is an everyday activity and poses a
   challenge for many people. To improve the ability to understand speech
   in noise, a computerized auditory rehabilitation game was developed. In
   Trivia Game players are challenged to answer trivia questions spoken
   aloud. As players progress through the game, the level of background
   noise increases. A study using Trivia Game was conducted as a
   proof-of-concept investigation in healthy participants.
   Method: College students with normal hearing were randomly assigned to a
   control (n = 13) or a treatment (n = 14) group. Treatment participants
   played Trivia Game 12 times over a 4-week period. All participants
   completed objective (auditory-only and audiovisual formats) and
   subjective listening in noise measures at baseline and 4 weeks later.
   Result: There were no statistical differences between the groups at
   baseline. At post-test, the treatment group significantly improved their
   overall speech understanding in noise in the audiovisual condition and
   reported significant benefits in their functional listening abilities.
   Conclusion: Playing Trivia Game improved speech understanding in noise
   in healthy listeners. Significant findings for the audiovisual condition
   suggest that participants improved face-reading abilities. Trivia Game
   may be a platform for investigating changes in speech understanding in
   individuals with sensory, linguistic and cognitive impairments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AGGRESSION AND CONFLICT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-56}},
Abstract = {{Some Internet genres, in particular Weblogs and discussion fora, have a
   dubious reputation for giving voice to strongly polemical discourses or
   hate-speech. This paper investigates the use of dehumanizing metaphors,
   specifically parasite metaphors, in British debates about immigration.
   It compares the range of metaphors used in Blogs with that used in
   online fora and in mainstream newspaper coverage and concludes that
   despite substantial variation, they can be categorised into four main
   scenarios, of which one includes dehumanizing metaphors such as
   depictions of immigrants as parasites, leeches, or bloodsuckers. Whilst
   this kind of stigmatizing imagery occurs across the three different
   media genres, the samples also show significant quantitative and
   qualitative differences: dehumanizing metaphors occur most often and
   their potential for aggressive argumentation and polemics is exploited
   in more detail in Blogs than in the fora, and least in the mainstream
   press. It is then asked what cognitive import this differential usage
   has in view of a) the discourse histories of such metaphors and b) their
   most likely present-day semantic motivation. The paper concludes that
   while it is unlikely that present-day users have detailed knowledge of
   the etymological and conceptual histories of such metaphors, it is also
   improbable to assume a wholly ``unconscious{''} or ``automatic{''} use
   or reception in the respective community of practice, and that instead
   it is more likely that they are used with a high degree of
   ``deliberateness{''} and a modicum of discourse-historical awareness.}},

   which space is constructed in verbal/written texts, this essay examines
   how such theories function in conjunction with the illustrations that
   often accompanied Victorian serialized narratives in their original
   publication. Specifically, I consider the interaction between the verbal
   and visual channels in the construction of interior rooms presented in
   these two novels and how this interaction is affected by the variance in
   the physical placement of the illustrations on the material page in
   relation to the verbal discourse. Thus, I ask to what extent the
   physical placement of the illustration on the page relative to the
   placement of verbal discourse that describes the scene interacts with
   the dialogic created by the two modes of perception in the visual and
   the verbal channels. Moreover, I show how this interaction prompts
   readers to recursively reconfigure the construction of the interior
   spaces as they engage with both narrative modes.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPeople with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities

   AimsTo explore speech and language therapists' (SLTs) decision making in
   communication interventions for people with PMLD, in terms of the
   intervention approaches used, the factors informing the decisions to use
   specific interventions and the extent to which the rationales
   underpinning these decisions related to the components of evidence based
   practice (EBP), namely empirical evidence, clinical experience and
   client/carer views and values.
   Methods \& ProceduresA questionnaire on communication assessment and
   intervention for people with PMLD was sent to SLTs in the UK to elicit
   information on: the communication intervention approaches they used;
   their rationales for their intervention choices; their use of published
   evidence to inform decision making.
   Outcomes \& ResultsIntensive interaction and objects of reference were
   the communication interventions most often used with people with PMLD,
   with some differences between children and adults evident. Rationales
   provided conformed somewhat to the EBP framework though extension of the
   existing framework and addition of practical and organizational
   considerations led to a revised typology of rationale for decision
   making. Rationales most frequently related to the empowerment,
   development and behavioural preferences of the person with PMLD.
   Conclusions \& ImplicationsEmpirical research evidence was seldom
   mentioned by SLTs as informing intervention decision making leading to
   very diverse practice. There is a need for further research on the
   effectiveness of commonly used but under-evaluated interventions. There
   is also a need to alert SLTs to the evidence base supporting other
   approaches, particularly switch-based, cause and effect approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent studies consider how the style of a text is recreated

   Nobel-Prize-winning German-Romanian writer Herta Muller were translated
   into English, and the possible effects of such changes on the
   construction of fictional minds by the English reader. These changes are
   of particular importance in this case because the novels deal with
   repression of various types - in the community and the family, by the
   state - and focus especially on the disjunction between thinking and
   speaking, and the uncertainty of what others are thinking. Considering
   how specific aspects of narrative perspective change when these novels

Abstract = {{Purpose: Previous studies have produced conflicting results with regard
   to the association between birth weight and developmental stuttering.
   This study sought to determine whether birth weight was associated with
   childhood and/or adolescent stuttering in three British birth cohort
   samples.
   Methods: Logistic regression analyses were carried out on data from the
   Millenium Cohort Study (MCS), British Cohort Study (BCS70) and National
   Child Development Study (NCDS), whose initial cohorts comprised over
   56,000 individuals. The outcome variables were parent-reported
   stuttering in childhood or in adolescence; the predictors, based on
   prior research, were birth weight, sex, multiple birth status,
   vocabulary score and mother's level of education. Birth weight was
   analysed both as a categorical variable (low birth weight, <2500g;
   normal range; high birth weight, >= 4000 g) and as a continuous
   variable. Separate analyses were carried out to determine the impact of
   birth weight and the other predictors on stuttering during childhood
   (age 3, 5 and 7 and MCS, BCS70 and NCDS, respectively) or at age 16,
   when developmental stuttering is likely to be persistent.
   Results: None of the multivariate analyses revealed an association
   between birth weight and parent-reported stuttering. Sex was a
   significant predictor of stuttering in all the analyses, with males
   1.6-3.6 times more likely than females to stutter.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that birth weight is not a clinically
   useful predictor of childhood or persistent stuttering. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The metaphorical categorization of social and political adversaries as

   transfer from the biological to the social domain. Historically,

   older tradition of religious and social meanings. The paper charts the

   AimsThis study tests the effect of a complex intervention in the context
   of childhood hearing impairment using a case study design of three
   families. Propositions for each case were made using parental report of
   the child's development in an attempt to identify change in outcome
   measurements that were not likely to be due to general development in
   the child or a halo effect from the intervention.
   Methods and ResultsMultiple pre- and post-intervention measures were
   taken. Outcome measures were mother-child contingencies to vocal
   utterances, emotional availability and an assessment of early
   communication in the child. Results for each case showed that
   improvements in some outcome measurements were found after the

Abstract = {{This study investigates how people interpret spoken sentences in the

   such as Put the book on the chair in the bucket, in which the
   prepositional phrase on the chair is temporarily ambiguous between a

   listeners heard these types of sentences (along with disambiguated

   that a classic garden-path effect is obtained only when listeners have a
   preview of the display and when the visual context contains relatively
   few objects. Results from a production experiment suggest that listeners
   accrue knowledge that may allow them to have certain expectations of the
   upcoming utterance based on visual information. Taken together, these
   findings have theoretical implications for both the role of prediction
   as an adaptive comprehension strategy, and for how comprehension
   tendencies change under variable visual and temporal processing demands.

   assessment changes the detail and types of comments, fostering an

Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{1090-1127}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gesture is often used as a modality to promote recovery of
   communication in aphasia, both as a compensation device and as a
   facilitator of language recovery. To date, there has been no systematic
   analysis of the quantitative effects of gesture training for aphasia in
   light of the quality of the research methods undertaken.Aims: The aim of
   the current project was to systematically evaluate the scientific
   evidence for the effects of symbolic and nonsymbolic gestural training
   in post-stroke aphasia. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate the effects
   of gesture treatment for measures of verbal and nonverbal
   communication.Methods \& Procedures: A systematic search of the
   literature was conducted between August and September 2012, on relevant
   electronic databases utilising 16 search terms. Study characteristics
   were summarised. The methodological quality of the studies was
   independently rated by the first two authors, using the PEDro and SCED
   scales for group and single-case experimental designs (SCEDs),
   respectively. Effect sizes were calculated where none was provided by
   the original manuscript.Results: This initial search yielded 177
   citations, of which 23 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 4 group
   designs and 19 SCEDs. Of the 134 individuals who participated in these
   studies, the majority had nonfluent moderatesevere chronic aphasia.
   Methodological rigour was weak in the group studies, but 11 of the 19
   SCEDs achieved high-quality scores of 8 or higher out of 10. Gesture
   training alone had nonsignificant effects on verbal production. Combined
   gesture+verbal training showed positive effects for verbal production of
   nouns and verbs for over 50\% of participants, with a mixed pattern of
   generalisation to untrained words and contexts. Gesture+verbal training
   paradigms had limited advantage over those with verbal training alone.
   Significant gains in gesture production were reported for trained
   gestures only following gesture training protocols. Few studies have
   examined generalisation to discourse. The effects of training with
   nonsymbolic gestures were less conclusive.Conclusions: Comparative
   effect sizes support a benefit of combined gesture+verbal treatment for
   noun and verb production for some individuals with aphasia. Whether that
   benefit surpasses the results of verbal treatment alone is not well
   established. Symbolic gestures can be acquired by individuals with
   aphasia, although their communicative effectiveness requires further
   study. Overall, gestural training in aphasia, while generating some
   positive outcomes, is relatively understudied. There is a need for
   large-scale investigation taking into account the considerable
   participant variability.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this project was to investigate the possible
   relation between standardized measures of vocabulary/language, mother
   and father education, and a composite measure of socioeconomic status
   (SES) for children who do not stutter (CWNS) and children who stutter
   (CWS).
   Methods: Participants were 138 CWNS and 159 CWS between the ages of 2;6
   and 6;3 and their families. The Hollingshead Four Factor Index of Social
   Position (i.e., Family SES) was used to calculate SES based on a
   composite score consisting of weighted values for paternal and maternal
   education and occupation. Statistical regression analyses were conducted
   to investigate the relation between parental education and language and
   vocabulary scores for both the CWNS and CWS. Correlations were
   calculated between parent education, Family SES, and stuttering severity
   (e.g., SSI-3 score, \% words stuttered).
   Results: Results indicated that maternal education contributed the
   greatest amount of variance in vocabulary and language scores for the
   CWNS and for participants from both groups whose Family SES was in the
   lowest quartile of the distribution. However, paternal education
   generally contributed the greatest amount of variance in vocabulary and
   language scores for the CWS. Higher levels of maternal education were
   associated with more severe stuttering in the CWS.
   Conclusion: Results are generally consistent with existing literature on
   normal language development that indicates maternal education is a
   robust predictor of the vocabulary and language skills of preschool
   children. Thus, both father and mothers' education may impact the
   association between vocabulary/language skills and childhood stuttering,
   leading investigators who empirically study this association to possibly
   re-assess their participant selection (e.g., a priori control of
   parental education) and/or data analyses (e.g., post hoc covariation of

   self-efficacy beliefs being the most strongly related to socio-economic
   status. The most important differences in motivation, self-regulation
   and learner autonomy were found between upper-middle and high social

Abstract = {{Implications of the World Report on Disability for people with

   The benefits of collecting population survey information are recognized,

   caseload level. In a country where rhetoric is far removed from lived
   experience, the starting points for change are very different from those
   in Minority world countries. A supply and demand model is suggested as
   an equitable way of balancing efforts to overcome barriers to a better
   service. Knowledge and information are shown to be key in catalyzing the
   demand side for the service, while the importance of a solid evidence
   base for practice would help to improve supply. Although a warning

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore whether parents of CWS
   reported the presence of ADHD symptoms that would warrant a referral to
   a psychologist to rule out the disorder. This study also aimed to
   describe the characteristics of the sample in terms of gender, family
   history of stuttering, presence of neurological impairment, concomitant
   diagnoses, and stuttering severity. Finally, this study sought to
   explore the possible statistical relations among these same variables.
   Methods: Participants were 36 school-age CWS (32 males and 4 females)
   between the ages of 3.9 and 17.2 years (M= 10.4, SD= 4.0). Parent
   responses on the ADHD Rating Scale (Power et al., 2001) were collected
   via a retrospective chart review.
   Results: For this sample 58\% (n = 21), of the participants met criteria
   for needing referral for additional evaluation for symptoms related to
   ADHD. A strong positive relation (r= 720, p <.001) was found between a
   reported family history of recovered stuttering and the presence of a
   concomitant diagnosis.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate the need for
   further training and education for SLPs working with 0/VS regarding
   ADHD.

Abstract = {{The acclaimed Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood published The Edible
   Woman in 1969 when feminism was becoming an influential trend in North
   America. Although this story has a radical feminist voice, The Edible
   Woman was translated by a male translator, Oura Akio, in 1996, and his
   language choice for the protagonist is excessively feminine.
   The theme of this novel, Marian's rejection of gender roles in society,
   would be in accordance with a rejection of the socially expected ideal
   female speaking style. This is especially so when it comes to Japanese
   because women's language was constructed culturally and ideologically in
   the late nineteenth century (Okamoto 1995:317). The belief about how
   women should speak has been shaped politically and socially through
   history (Inoue 2006:15).
   Nevertheless, in the Japanese translation, readers are likely to find a
   contradictory figure in Marian in the Japanese translation and she seems
   to be happy to use impeccable women's language given and promoted by
   male-dominant authorities. The contradiction can be an obstacle to
   conveying the author's message to the readers who read the novel in
   Japanese. The author's intention can thus be lost in the translation.
   Even if the content of the novel has not been changed, the readers would
   perceive the wrong sort of character. In the Japanese translation,
   Marian seems to be obedient to the male-dominated idea because of her
   language use. This fact interferes with the novel's feminist purpose. I
   therefore examine the effect of Marian's language use in the Japanese
   translation from a reader-response theory and, a relevance theory point
   of view.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed universal relationship between status and solidarity in

   The degree of reciprocity, solidarity, and inequality in dyadic address
   exchange were analyzed and using a statistical approach allowed to
   directly compare the linguistic patterns of expected and observed values
   in two languages. The address exchange showed no consistency with
   expected theoretical values for certain categories of Brown's (1965)
   theory. Differences in politeness were found between the two countries.
   Effects of cultural differences and social change governing the

Abstract = {{Background: Communication and swallowing changes are prominent in

   Aims: To conduct a survey of people with Parkinson's disease and their
   carers in the United Kingdom to elicit their views concerning
   communication and swallowing changes in Parkinson's disease and the
   support they envisage in helping with these changes.
   Methods \& Procedures: A national survey utilizing a questionnaire
   developed for the project, accessible by people with Parkinson's disease
   in web-based, e-mail or paper forms.
   Outcomes \& Results: A total of 168 people with Parkinson's disease
   (median = 7 years since diagnosis, range = 0.5-30) and 47 carers who
   provided their impression of the experience of the PwPD responded. Of
   these 215, 92 (43\%) had no contact with SLT services. In general those
   who had seen an SLT found it a positive experience. Pointers for
   improvement centred around timing, intensity, duration and access to SLT
   as well as issues around transfer and maintenance of gains outside of
   clinic and (lack of) attention to psychosocial dimensions. Availability
   of ongoing support as the situation evolved and access to SLT when it
   was needed were two prominent features desired of a responsive service.
   Conclusions \& Implications: Responses suggest that when SLT is
   available it offers positive support, but respondents felt (re)access
   when and where SLT is needed could improve, as well as what aspects of
   swallowing and communication were addressed in assessment and therapy.
   We reflect on possible recommendations to address the challenges for SLT

Abstract = {{Background: Communication and swallowing changes feature prominently in

   under-represented in speech-language therapy clinics in the United
   Kingdom. The nature of the speech-language therapy services in the UK to
   people with Parkinson's disease has not been examined.
   Aims: To ascertain the number of speech-language therapists in the UK
   who work with people with Parkinson's disease; to establish the nature
   of contacts in terms of caseloads, referral stages and routes,
   management practices, assessments and treatments employed; and to
   reflect on service provision in relation to published guidelines.
   Methods \& Procedures: A questionnaire survey of speech-language
   therapists.
   Outcomes \& Results: A total of 185 speech-language therapists
   responded. They were treating a median of three (inter-quartile range
   (IQR) = 1-6) people with Parkinson's disease with a further median of
   five (IQR = 1-10) on review. The majority of contacts were for
   assessment and advice given, especially in later and earlier stages of
   Parkinson's disease. Typically, respondents offered a median of six
   sessions (IQR = 6-8) of treatment, each session lasting a median of 45
   min (IQR = 45-60), delivered over a median period of 42 days (IQR =
   28-56). Speech-language therapists worked in a variety of settings,
   predominantly hospital. They received referrals principally from medical
   specialities, from whom the majority had support. Referrals were
   perceived in general to be later in Parkinson's disease progression than
   desired. Assessment focused primarily on impairment measures, in
   contrast to a belief that therapy focus on activity and participation
   issues. Speech-language therapists were relatively confident in treating
   people with Parkinson's disease, but 75\% wanted more training.
   Conclusions \& Implications: Speech-language therapist services for
   people with Parkinson's disease in the UK are restricted on most
   dimensions. Management practices often do not match guideline
   suggestions. Consideration needs to be given to the training for,
   content of and delivery of speech-language therapy services for people

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relation
   between utterance complexity and utterance position and the tendency to
   stutter on function words in preschool-age children who stutter (CWS).
   Two separate studies involving two different groups of participants
   (Study 1, n = 30; Study 2, n = 30) were conducted. Participants were
   preschool-age CWS between the age of 3,0 and 5,11 who engaged in 15-20
   min parent child conversational interactions. From audio video
   recordings of each interaction, every child utterance of each parent
   child sample was transcribed. From these transcripts, for each
   participant, measures of language (e.g., length and complexity) and
   measures of stuttering (e.g., word type and utterance position) were
   obtained. Results of Study I indicated that children stuttered more
   frequently on function words, but that this tendency was not greater for
   complex than simple utterances. Results of Study 2, involving the
   assessment of utterance position and MLU quartile, indicated that that
   stuttering was more likely to occur with increasing sentence length, and
   that stuttering tended to occur at the utterance-initial position, the
   position where function words were also more likely to occur. Findings
   were taken to suggest that, although word-level influences cannot be
   discounted, utterance-level influences contribute to the loci of
   stuttering in preschool-age children, and may help account for
   developmental changes in the loci of stuttering.
   Educational objectives: The reader will learn about and be able to: (a)
   describe the influence of word type (function versus content words), and
   grammatical complexity, on disfluent speech; (b) compare the effect of
   stuttering frequency based on the position of the word in the utterance;

   speakers have towards the Spanish language and culture, specifically, in
   relation to the speech act of thanking and in connection with Brown and

   used: First, a corpus of 64 course books which included 250 situations
   representing the speech act of thanking and, second, a questionnaire for
   the teaching of Spanish as a Foreign Language. The situations including
   the speech act of thanking were analysed and then categorized according
   to various criteria. The criteria were created by taking into
   consideration Coulmas' (1981) proposal for the classification of
   thanking as well as the components of this specific speech act. The most
   frequent situations found in the course books were then used to devise
   the second source of data. The aim of this was to determine the
   attitudes of 300 participants, divided equally between the nationalities
   used in the investigation, Spanish, British and American. The
   questionnaire included 12 scenarios in which the thanking formula was
   omitted. Participants were prompted to answer questions based on their
   perceptions and to include other responses whenever they considered them
   to be appropriate. The main findings provided evidence of different
   facework values across the three groups of informants for some of the
   specific scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of data
   showed that some of the responses were connected to the thanking
   formulae, but others to speech acts such as request formulae.}},

Abstract = {{A non-standard form of the definite article is used by upwards of a
   million speakers every day and yet it has received little attention in
   terms of a phonological analysis. The most recent discussions have been
   a historical and contemporary survey, spectrographic investigations and
   sociolinguistic surveys. It is clearly a complex issue and has relevance
   to a number of theoretical questions, some of which are rarely
   addressed. We need to know the range of phonetic forms; the phonological
   distribution of the forms; the historical development and whether this
   helps with a synchronic analysis; and the number and nature of the
   lexical storage forms. The distribution varies between localities and
   between speakers; many speakers also use standard English the. The
   historical development is not at all clear, but does throw some light on
   what the synchronic grammars should be like. There appears to be a break
   between those grammars in which the phonetic forms of the definite
   article are predictable in terms of the phonological environment and
   those later grammars that have lexically specific forms. The changes
   that have taken place cannot be explained in terms of simple
   system-internal mechanisms and some knowledge of the sociohistorical
   background to the emergence of the new grammars is necessary. This
   article looks at historical sources from the mid seventeenth century
   onwards to try to determine the changes that have taken place in the
   northern dialects concerned, and proposes population movements and
   expansion as a determining factor in the changes that are in evidence.
   One possible scenario in terms of new-dialect formation during the
   nineteenth century is suggested. For the modern variants polysystemic,
   declarative grammars are proposed, with the possibility of
   grammar-switching under certain circumstances, Such as repair or
   interaction with outsiders.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the relationship between degree of lesion in
   various locations and improvement during treatment in stroke patients
   with chronic aphasia. The main purpose of this study was to determine
   whether the degree of lesion in specific brain regions was related to
   magnitude of improvement over the course of object and action naming
   treatments.
   Participants and methods: Fifteen left hemisphere stroke patients with
   aphasia participated in treatments for object and/or action naming. Two
   raters assessed extent of lesion in 18 left hemisphere cortical and
   subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) on CT or MRI scans. Correlations
   were calculated between composite basal ganglia, anterior cortical, and
   posterior cortical lesion ratings, on the one hand, and both
   pretreatment scores and treatment change for both object and action
   naming, on the other hand.
   Results: Unexpectedly, greater anterior cortical lesion extent was
   highly correlated with better object and action naming scores prior to
   treatment and with greater improvement during treatment when partial
   correlations controlled for total basal ganglia lesion extent (r ranging
   from .730 to .858). Greater total basal ganglia lesion extent was highly
   correlated with worse object and action naming scores prior to treatment
   and with less improvement during treatment when partial correlations
   controlled for total anterior lesion extent (r ranging from -.623 to
   -.785). Correlations between degree of posterior cortical lesion and
   naming indices generally were not significant. No consistent differences
   were found between the correlations of ROI lesion ratings with object
   naming versus action naming scores.
   Conclusion: Large anterior cortical lesions and intactness of the basal
   ganglia may both contribute to more efficient reorganization of language
   functions. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   findings indicate that when instructors use podcasts for multiple
   instructional purposes (e.g., to critique student projects and exams,
   for student video presentations, for student paired interviews, to
   complete specific assignments, dictations, in roundtable discussions, or
   for guest lectures), students are more likely to use this technology and
   to report academic benefits. While the study is limited by small sample
   sizes and by some within-group variation in instructional techniques,
   the study provides initial evidence that podcast technology has the
   potential to provide greater benefits if it is used more than simply as

Abstract = {{Following an acknowledgement of colleagues who have critiqued a work,
   writers sometimes add that the final version is the sole responsibility
   of the author(s), and not of anyone being thanked. Although there is
   much variability in responsibility statements, they are formulaic and
   often consist of the following: a reference to the conventional nature
   of the statement, a reference to the content of or potential
   shortcomings in the writing, and a mention of the authors' sole
   responsibility and/or exoneration of others for conclusions or
   deficiencies. For example: ``Naturally, I remain responsible for any
   mistakes still present.{''}
   This paper investigates the face-enhancing value of responsibility
   statements. Like thanks, gambits, and apologies, responsibility
   statements are formulaic disclaimers. They exonerate others from blame,
   but also allow authors to claim ownership of and credit for their work.
   Responsibility statements allow authors to establish a professional
   persona and demonstrate that they know the conventions of their
   profession. Responsibility statements allow authors to present
   themselves as formal or scholarly, or they can violate the conventions
   and present themselves as humorous, creative, or individualistic. (C)

   Method: In this narrative review, they define neuroplasticity and review
   studies that demonstrate neural changes associated with aphasia recovery
   and treatment. The authors then summarize basic science evidence from
   animals, human cognition, and computational neuroscience that is
   relevant to aphasia treatment research. They then turn to the aphasia
   treatment literature in which evidence exists to support several of the
   neuroscience principles.
   Conclusion: Despite the extant aphasia treatment literature, many
   questions remain regarding how neuroscience principles can be
   manipulated to maximize aphasia recovery and treatment. They propose a
   framework, incorporating some of these principles, that may serve as a
   potential roadmap for future investigations of aphasia treatment and
   recovery. In addition to translational investigations from basic to
   clinical science, the authors propose several areas in which translation
   can occur from clinical to basic science to contribute to the

Abstract = {{Background: Discourse analysis is a key element in determining treatment
   effects. However, it is extremely labour intensive, requiring in-depth
   knowledge of linguistics and aphasiology; thus, it is often neglected in
   the analysis of treatment outcomes. A clinically practical method of
   discourse analysis would be beneficial for evaluation and determination
   of treatment efficacy.
   Aims: The current study investigates changes in discourse content
   following contrasting treatments for anomia using grammatical analysis.
   In addition, we pilot the use of a new information measure.
   Methods \& Procedures: We compare discourse changes after a
   gestural+verbaltreatment and a semantic-phonologic treatment for nouns
   and verbs on two groups of individuals with aphasia. Analyses compared
   discourse samples from 14 participants taken at baseline, post-phase 1,
   and post-phase 2. In addition to traditional measures such as number of
   nouns, verbs, and sentence types, a new measure of information is
   introduced, the Utterance with New Information (UNI). The UNI is
   designed to assess content in non-propositional, impaired speech in
   open-ended discourse.
   Outcomes \& Results: Noun production increased in participants of both
   treatments, whereas grammatical sentences increased only in participants
   of the semantic-phonologic treatment. Production of UNIs increased in
   participants of both treatments as well as over time.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a few easily counted measures
   of discourse production can provide clinically useful information for
   the clinician. Moreover, these findings suggest discourse analysis is a
   viable method of determining treatment outcomes especially given that
   improving discourse is the ultimate goal of all aphasia treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the UK clinical supervision is regarded as an essential
   process supporting quality improvement within the clinical governance
   framework, and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists
   regards it as a tool for promoting critical reflective practice. There
   is limited evidence of the impact on practice or improvements in
   healthcare quality, and the need for an evaluation instrument
   specifically tailored to group supervision.
   Aims: To develop a measure for assessing staff perspectives on the
   quality of clinical group supervision and its impact on the quality of
   care.
   Methods \& Procedures: A self-completion questionnaire was devised to
   measure staff perceptions of purpose, process and impact of clinical
   group supervision. Items were developed through an inductive process of
   consultation, peer and literature review. The questionnaire's content
   validity was assessed. The questionnaire was then administered to 57
   subjects who had received approximately 1 year of clinical supervision
   to evaluate acceptability, factor structure and convergent validity.
   Outcomes \& Results: Response rates were 91\% (52/57). Principal
   component factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure, the first
   three factors accounting for 72.4\% of the total variance. Items loaded
   appropriately onto purpose, process and impact. These three dimensions
   were positively and moderately correlated. Internal consistency
   reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.86) indicated that the 14 items could be
   regarded as a scale. The overall CSEQ score was positively correlated
   with a single question assessing `general opinion' about the CS program
   (Spearman's rho=0.79, p<0.001) giving evidence for convergent validity.
   Conclusions: The questionnaire is concise, easy to complete and simple
   to analyse, and appears to be a reliable and valid measure of staff
   perceptions of quality of clinical group supervision. Further studies
   with larger sample sizes and including other groups of health
   professionals are needed to confirm the validity and reliability of the

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{528-564}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The methods used by therapists in the process of language
   therapy with people with aphasia are seldom explicitly described in
   therapy studies. Language impairment therapy is often reported in terms
   of tasks or activities. Reference to cueing or feedback may be made, but
   the role played by the person with aphasia in these processes usually
   goes unreported. It has been argued, however, that therapy is not
   synonymous with the task but takes place through the interactive work
   between therapist and person with aphasia.
   Aims: To examine therapy between experienced clinicians and people with
   aphasia in day-to-day practice, addressing a number of questions
   relating to: the characteristic features of the interaction between
   therapist and aphasic person; identification of the ``main business'' of
   the session; the relationship between the ``main business'' and other
   aspects of the session; the evidence for more explicit definitions of
   therapy techniques such as those described in the literature as
   ``cueing'', ``prompting'', ``scaffolding'', ``facilitation'', and
   ``feedback''. These questions were addressed with the aim of making
   description of therapy practice more explicit in order (1) to improve
   the quality of therapy studies, including replications (which rely on,
   among other things, detailed reporting of treatment variables); (2) to
   improve understanding of what ``works''/ ``doesn't work''; (3) to
   improve understanding of the contributions of both therapist and client;
   (4) to improve the quality and effectiveness of therapy; (5) to improve
   communication with clients, carers, other professionals, and students.
   Methods and Procedures: In order to develop an explicit and consistent
   vocabulary for describing and analysing the enactment of therapy, an
   observational study was carried out. A total of 15 therapist-aphasic
   person dyads participated in the study, contributing videotape and
   audiotape recordings of 41 therapy sessions. Videotapes and audiotape
   transcriptions were subject to qualitative analysis using a variety of
   methods derived from ethnography and Conversation Analysis.
   Outcomes \& Results: This study describes the enactment of tasks in ways
   that (1) account for the interactive nature of therapist and aphasic
   person contributions; (2) demonstrate how processes of task- related
   work are distributed across the session as a whole; and (3) address
   task-related work as a technical and a social process.
   Conclusions: In this study therapy is examined and the processes through
   which it takes place are made explicit in a systematic and orderly
   fashion, addressing the ways in which task- related work is enacted, and
   revealing the roles of the participants in the conduct of that work.
   This study confirms the scope of previous conceptualisations of the
   enactment of therapy, and provides a data- driven description of
   therapy. In addition, processes through which therapists gained and
   maintained control of sessions were found to be similar to those
   reported in studies of other healthcare settings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Semantic comprehension training paired with verbal
   production leads to improved word retrieval in individuals with aphasia.
   Few studies have also examined effects of such training for word
   comprehension. MossTalk Words includes a training module to provide
   semantic comprehension training via computerised exercises. Variations
   in the treatment schedule may influence the impact of word retrieval and
   comprehension treatment gains.
   Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the
   Multi-Mode Matching Exercises module of MossTalk Words for improving
   word comprehension and retrieval in individuals with aphasia. Effects of
   training were contrasted for two treatment schedules.
   Methods \& Procedures: Five individuals with word retrieval impairments
   associated with aphasia participated. Two had word comprehension
   difficulties suggesting semantic anomia, and three others with intact
   comprehension had impairments suggesting phonologic anomia. In a
   single-participant design, we investigated effects of training provided
   via computer with MossTalk multi-mode matching exercises (spoken and
   written word/picture matching) paired with spoken rehearsal. All
   participated in two phases of training administered 1-2 times/week and
   3-4 times/week, with order of phases counterbalanced across
   participants.
   Outcomes \& Results: Improvements in word/picture yes/no verification
   for trained and some untrained words associated with large effect sizes
   (d > 2.5) were evident in one of two participants when trained 1-2
   times/week. Increases in picture naming associated with large effect
   sizes for trained words were noted in 515 participants when trained 4-5
   times/week, and in 2/5 participants when trained 1-2 times/week.
   Increases in picture naming for untrained words were evident in 2/5
   participants in the more frequent training schedule. At I month post
   training, picture naming performance remained above baseline levels,
   with little difference evident between sets trained with the two
   different training schedules.
   Conclusions: Computerised lexical training exercises may lead to
   increases in word comprehension and production, particularly for the
   target words trained. More frequent training leads to greater
   improvements during acquisition than less frequent training, but that
   advantage diminishes at 1 month post treatment, suggesting that a less
   frequent training schedule may be just as useful as more frequent
   training for promoting long-term effects of lexical training.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Terms such as `clinical intuition' have often been applied
   to the practice of speech and language therapy. Various authors have
   aimed to make the process of therapy practice more explicit, and it is
   argued that recently developed descriptive/analytic frameworks have the
   potential to engender the critical mindset necessary for student speech
   and language therapists to become good reflective practitioners, with
   the potential for enhancing clinical education.
   Aims: To investigate whether and how aspects of clinical skills
   education could be usefully addressed in an academic, as opposed to a
   clinical, setting. The study aimed to address the question of whether
   use of an interaction analysis system, in conjunction with video
   observation, and `practice simulation' in a teaching-learning programme
   could be shown to have a positive impact on: (1) students' perceptions
   of their own understanding and practice of therapy, and their
   perceptions of themselves as self-reflective practitioners; and whether
   (2) this was borne out by students' ability to observe and interpret
   therapeutic interaction, as measured by (i) an objective written
   assessment; (ii) an objective video observation assessment; and (iii)
   assessment of their abilities in clinical practice.
   Methods \& Procedures: Thirty-six students from City University took
   part in an experimental, placebo-controlled study using a deferred
   intervention design. Assessments designed to reflect changes resulting
   from the teaching-learning curriculum were carried out pre- and
   post-intervention with experimental and control groups. Quantitative and
   qualitative results were obtained.
   Outcomes \& Results: The intervention programme was found to have had a
   significant impact on students' perceptions of their understanding of
   therapy, but not on their perceptions of their practice of therapy. The
   experimental group scored significantly better on a written assessment
   of `interpretation of therapy interaction', but were no better than the
   control group on a `Video observation' assessment. Owing to attrition
   and the poor quality of videos submitted for assessment, it was not
   possible to measure changes in actual clinical practice. Qualitative
   feedback from the teaching-learning programme suggests that students
   generally found the approach to be beneficial.
   Conclusions: While there were some encouraging results, it is still
   uncertain whether addressing the actual practice of therapy in an
   academic setting gives `added value' to the work carried out on clinical
   placements. However, there is no doubt that bringing this type of
   programme under the umbrella of an academic institution would greatly
   increase the consistency of teaching and the range of experiences
   available to students.}},

Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6-7}},
Pages = {{607-624}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the fact that spelling impairments are common
   following left hemisphere injury, only a limited number of studies have
   examined effects of treatments for acquired spelling disorders. In
   general, following spelling treatment, individuals with spelling
   impairments related to the orthographic output lexicon have demonstrated
   improvements restricted to trained words, whereas individuals with
   impairments of the graphemic buffer demonstrate spelling improvements
   for both trained and untrained items.
   Aims: This study was designed to examine patterns of spelling
   generalisation following treatment in an individual whose spelling
   impairment related to disruption affecting at least these two stages in
   the spelling process.
   Methods \& Procedures: Assessment of spelling abilities in one
   gentleman, NM, with severe agraphia indicated impairment related to the
   orthographic output lexicon and graphemic buffer stages of spelling. In
   a single subject experimental treatment design, we employed a copy and
   recall treatment for two sets of words trained sequentially, and
   examined generalisation of training improvements to untrained words with
   similar beginning or ending spellings and nonwords.
   Outcomes \& Results: NM improved spelling of two sets of trained words.
   He also demonstrated generalised improvements in spelling some untrained
   whole words. Generalisation was greater for parts of untrained words
   that were similar in spelling to trained words, and was also greater for
   the beginnings compared to the endings of words.
   Conclusions: We contend that the pattern of spelling generalisation
   observed in NM implicates improvements affecting two stages of spelling.
   Greater improvements when spelling beginning or ending parts of
   untrained words with similar spellings to trained words implicates
   changes mediated by the orthographic output lexicon. Improvements for
   some untrained words and an advantage to beginning over ending spellings
   suggests strengthening of the graphemic buffer. These spelling
   improvements also led to a functional impact on NM's use of spelling in
   daily activities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nonfluent verbal production in individuals with
   transcortical motor aphasia (TMA) relates primarily to impaired
   initiation of verbalisation. Luria (1973) proposed the notion of
   gestural reorganisation, limb movements used to provoke verbalisations,
   as a means to improve verbal initiation in aphasia. In particular,
   movements performed with the left hand in left space may engage right
   frontal mechanisms to enhance verbal initiation (Crosson, Singletary,
   Richards, Koehler, \& Rothi, 2000). However, little evidence is
   available as to the effects of this type of treatment for nonfluent
   verbal production in TMA.
   Aims: We administered a treatment in which we incorporated nonsymbolic
   limb movements during production of sentences and evaluated the effects
   on verbal fluency in our participant, MP, who had TMA.
   Methods \& Procedures: We used a single-participant experimental
   treatment design across behaviours. During training, MP tapped with his
   left hand in left space as he practised production of sentences for
   polysemous words (e.g., bank: money, river). In daily probes, we
   measured percent correct sentences generated and time to produce correct
   sentences for trained and untrained polysemous words, as well as number
   of words generated per minute in a control letter category fluency task.
   Outcomes \& Results: Sentence-generation accuracy improved in two
   trained sets and one untrained set when movement was included during
   treatment. Little change was evident in the control letter category
   fluency task. Following training, MP produced increased numbers of words
   and well-formed utterances in connected speech samples as well.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that movement training had some
   benefit for NIP's sentence generation, perhaps due to recruitment of
   alternative frontal regions to enhance verbal initiation and fluency.
   Replication is needed with similar subjects who undergo treatment in
   conjunction with functional neuroimaging to evaluate this possibility.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an improved method of integrating audio and visual
   information in a HMM-based audiovisual ASR system. The method uses a
   modified semicontinuous HMM (SCHMM) for integration and recognition. Our
   results show substantial improvements over earlier integration methods
   at high noise levels.
   Our integration method relies on the assumption that, as environmental
   conditions deviate from those under which training occurred, the
   underlying probability distributions will also change. We use phoneme
   based SCHMMs for classification of isolated words. The probability
   models underlying the standard SCHMM are Gaussian; thus, low probability
   estimates will tend to be associated with high confidences (small
   differences in the feature values cause large proportional differences
   in probabilities, when the values are in the tail of the distribution).
   Therefore, during classification, we replace each Gaussian with a
   scoring function which looks Gaussian mar the mean of the distribution
   but has a heavier tail.
   We report results comparing this method with an audio-only system and
   with previous integration methods. At high noise levels, the system with
   modified scoring functions shows a better than 50recognition does suffer
   when noise is low. Methods which can adjust the relative weight of the
   audio and visual information can still potentially outperform the new
   method, provided that a reliable way of choosing those weights can be
   found.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an approach for efficiently computing a compact
   temporal/spectral feature set for representing a segment of speech, with
   effective resolution depending on both frequency and time position
   within the segment. The goal is to mimic the resolution properties of
   the human auditory system, but using a computationally efficient
   FFT-based front end rather than a more complex auditory model. In
   particular we apply both frequency and time `'warping'' to FFT spectra
   to obtain good frequency resolution at low frequencies and good time
   resolution at high frequencies. Time resolution is also varied so that
   the center of the segment is better represented than the endpoints. The
   resolution can be varied by the selection of `'warping'' functions
   controlled using a small number of parameters. The method was
   experimentally verified for the classification of six stops extracted
   from the TIMIT continuous speech data base. The best classification rate
   obtained was 81.2\% for test data using 50 features computed with the
   method presented.}},
