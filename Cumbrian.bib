Abstract = {{This article addresses one of the most theoretically and linguistically
   vexing issues in the history of English poetic language: stylistic
   variation in Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads. It suggests
   that two footnotes, added to the 1800 edition, offer a new perspective
   on a question which has prompted debate since its publication:
   specifically, what is the relationship between Wordsworth's use of
   dialect and the language of `low and rustic life' promised by the 1800
   Preface to Lyrical Ballads? In sections 1 and 2 the article expands on
   the importance of the footnotes in relation to the discussion
   surrounding Wordsworth's language. Section 3 examines the departure of
   Lyrical Ballads from 18th-century conventions regarding the glossing of
   non-standard language in poetry, while section 4 explores the function
   of the unfootnoted and unframed regionalisms that can be found
   throughout the collection. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the content of the
   two footnotes in relation to Wordsworth's blurring of the roles of poet
   and glosser, and suggest that this conflation of roles is connected to
   Wordsworth's implicit blurring of Standard English and dialect in his
   definition of `low and rustic life' (a definition explored in greater
   detail in section 7). The conclusion suggests that the lack of
   specificity in Wordsworth's Preface and his approach to framing dialect
   were part of a single strategy to integrate Standard English and dialect
   in a more organic manner than was typical of 18th-century writing.}},
