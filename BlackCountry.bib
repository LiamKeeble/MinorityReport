Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{This study sheds light on the socio-economic factors determining the
   (re)location of sociolinguistic prestige in postcolonial environments.
   It uses the case of Namibia, an ethnolinguistically diverse African
   country that replaced Afrikaans - an established lingua franca - with
   English as its official language to weaken the hold of the formerly
   ruling White Afrikaans-speaking minority on its linguistic marketplace
   while symbolically empowering the Black majority. Using phonetic
   features elicited from an ethnolinguistically representative sample, the
   study finds that Whites align with South African norms while Non-Whites
   are developing distinctly local varieties. While `Coloured' Afrikaans
   varieties exert some gravitational pull on Black Afrikaans varieties, a
   more autonomous Black English variety spearheaded by women is emerging.
   Informant perceptions confirm the observed polarisation between Whites
   and Non-Whites, with the former not perceived as a linguistic target,
   while the valorisation of an ethnically neutral Black urban identity
   appears as a major driving force behind variation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban bias remains a debated topic in South Africa in many spheres of
   society. Due to the logic of apartheid, `rural' came to mean `black', or
   in post-apartheid-speak `previously disadvantaged'. Up to today, the
   effects of long-term structural and systematic disadvantaging are quite
   tangible in the country. Though in parts also applicable to urban
   settings, poverty, insufficient infrastructure and lack of access are
   largely foremost still a problem of the rural - and mostly black -
   population. These structural imbalances are purported through a number
   of social fields including academia. Often, studies are conducted where
   access and conveniences are close and risks impeding the successful
   completion of research projects are low. While the tendency to consider
   feasibility in research is not per se questionable, the total body of
   research projects and results might foreground a distorted reflection of
   South Africa's sociolinguistic landscape. Binary categories of
   urban/rural, however, carry a certain bias within themselves and are
   thus not comfortably fitting in a South African context but call for
   deconstruction. On this background, the chapter presents a critical
   review of 135 scholarly articles (2010-2017) from the eminent linguistic
   journal Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies
   examined for traces of urban bias in the research set up and weighs the
   results in the light of the current socio-political situation in South
   Africa.}},

Abstract = {{During the apartheid era in South Africa, protest songs were effectively
   used to challenge the dominance of the now defunct government. It was
   through protest songs that previously oppressed black South Africans
   expressed their emotions. Protest songs aim at bringing about an
   interaction of a people's conscious and subconscious behavioural forces.
   27 April 1994 is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of South
   Africa. This date brought about political changes in the country. This
   article seeks to determine the impact of protest songs by applying
   Sigmund Freud's theory of psychodynamics with its focus on the dynamic
   relations between conscious and unconscious motivations. One major
   characteristic of protest songs is that they are viewed as songs that
   belong to the category of topical songs. As these songs are sung and
   performed, the following question is always asked: What is the primary
   objective of singing the songs? In order to answer this question,
   Sigmund Freud's theory shall be used to analyse the selected songs.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most effective space of colonial domination has always been
   language. In the case of the Portuguese colonialism, it was exclusively
   through the Portuguese language that a black African could be considered
   as a cidadao or an indigena, according to discriminatory laws (which
   were being changed through the times until reaching the so-called
   ``Portuguese Indigenous Statue in Guinea, Angola and Mozambique{''},
   1954). The Portuguese language was therefore the only linguistic vehicle
   of citizenship, thus restricting the use of ethnic languages -
   considered, in a demeaning way, dialects - in formal and official public
   spaces. This situation has been extended to the linguistic policies of
   the postcolonial States. The present paper aims to reflect on this
   colonial heritage, by revealing the meanderings of the epistemology of
   decolonization and on the conditions of language awareness of the power
   relations among different languages in Africa (European and native),
   mainly in the five African Portuguese-speaking countries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on regional variation of Tai Dam initial

   Variation Theory in which Tai Dam single initials are used as dependent
   variables, with the locations of Tai Dam speakers serving as independent
   variables. Based on the variation and change of the Tai Dam single
   initials, they are classified into three groups. The first group
   consists of thirteen single initials which remain intact. The second
   group includes five initials which internally change from Old Tai Dam
   and show no regional variation. The last group has nineteen single
   initials which change from Old Tai Dam and are varied according to

Abstract = {{Online gaming has been a fascinating field of study for the last ten
   years, especially in the field of socialization (Kolo \& Baur, 2004) or
   even language use and language learning (Thorne, Black \& Sykes, 2009).
   It has become clear that gamers are able to perform processes of
   identification in completely new ways in these particular contexts, yet
   forums linked to specific games become a new source of metapragmatic or
   metadiscursive utterances. Through their experiences in the game, users
   make comments, assumptions and draw conclusions in order to `do
   identity' and separate themselves from Others. The aim of this paper
   will be to analyse the discourses produced in a corpus of forum
   discussions linked to ``DotA 2{''}, a popular moba (multi-player online
   battle arena) game where players from every country of the world gather,
   which leads to specific forms of discrimination-especially towards
   Russian gamers. In order to analyse these discursive productions and
   their semantic and pragmatic impacts, we will use three different
   approaches in order to triangulate our results: a lexicometric analysis
   (Garric \& Capdevielle-Mougnibas, 2009), the semantic study of
   argumentative possibilities (Galatanu, 2009) and the mobilization of the
   proximization model (Cap, 2010), in order to understand the semantic
   variations and dynamics that are at use when gamers publish discourses
   about Russian players. In particular, we wish to explore how these
   precise discourses about Russian players are drawing on pragmatics of
   common sense (Sarfati, 2011), insofar as they rely on prediscourses
   (Paveau, 2006) to maintain pragmatic effects which imply cognitive
   impacts on speakers (Maillat \& Oswald, 2009) as well as on the
   interdiscourses at use (Garric \& Longhi, 2013).}},

Abstract = {{The Association for German Studies in Southern Africa, or SAGV, was
   established in 1966. From its beginnings the Association modelled
   itself, in terms of its self-image and its academic approach, on its
   counterpart in Germany. Yet its history has always been deeply embedded
   in contemporary events and the social realities in South Africa. The
   study of German language and literature in this country was confined to
   the white community, from the 19th century onwards. The 1930s saw a
   split between, roughly speaking, conservative Afrikaans-medium
   universities and the more liberal English-language institutions, a
   division which affected the subject of German as well. The founding of
   the SAGV can be seen, at least in part, as an attempt at bringing
   together the two directions under the banner of an internationally
   accepted standard of academic practice. Black South Africans, while
   never explicitly excluded, were never significantly represented in the
   subject of German and its Association. In spite of the turmoil of the
   Apartheid years, the SAGV remained true to its founding aims and
   principles and has continued in this spirit since the major political
   shift in the 1990s. Today the major challenge is whether the society can
   move from a predominantly German focus to an African one, and thus
   continue in the political and cultural climate in a changed South
   Africa.}},

   Lope de Aguirre, with motifs and modes that change depending on time,

   twentieth-century dramatist to devote a text, entitled Lope de Aguirre,
   to the life of the Basque conqueror. The work, for reasons that will be
   explored in the present essay, was never staged in Franco's time:
   Ballester's Aguirre is a romantic hero who defies the king to defeat the
   injustices which he is forced to witness, and everyone, men, women,
   blacks, indios, will at last be free under his red-black banner. Dona
   Elvira, Imaginate Euskadi (1985), by Ignacio Amestoy Egiguren, is the

Abstract = {{This article considers how conscious use of dialect in writing is an

   enregisterment. It does this by exploring the value of dialect in social
   and ideological contexts in relation to a regional dialect of British
   speech, that of the Black Country in the West Midlands region of
   England. The article provides a summary of recent directions in
   sociolinguistic research and an overview of the Black Country speech
   community, including a summary of its distinctive linguistic variables.
   This description is then used as an external evaluation of the
   authenticity of written representations of Black Country speech and the
   items enregistered in writing. Analysis of three written texts taken
   from three different genres across a time span of 30 years reveals the
   extent to which identified linguistic features are drawn upon in each
   one of the three texts and the extent to which any one is enregisterd
   across all three. The article discusses the social and linguistic
   contexts within which the writing occurs by way of accounting for their
   enregisterment as markers of identity linked to region and place. It
   also considers the ways in which the texts juxtapose norms and values of

   categorization in which they are labeled as `White'. This paper examines
   data from informal interviews with teenage immigrants who come from a
   number of eastern European countries including Russia, Ukraine, Armenia,
   and Bulgaria and are bound by their affiliation with hip-hop culture.
   They live mainly in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens and express
   their affiliation with hip-hop through stylized language and lifestyle
   practices. For many, hip-hop culture and Black American culture more
   broadly offer more attractive models for identity formation than the
   surrounding White mainstream culture. Their use of hip-hop linguistic
   markers and other forms of identity display place them at odds with
   their compatriots who have chosen to align themselves with the White
   mainstream. This is evident in verbal interactions at both the
   linguistic and discursive level as young people negotiate a place in
   their adopted homeland. Taken together, the data raise interesting
   questions about the relationship of hip-hop stylized speech to existing
   ethnolects such as African American English and the extent to which this
   speech style represents ail emerging ethnolect in its own right.}},

Abstract = {{The change from Vergil's Aeneid to Homer's Illiad as the definitive
   ideal of epic style in 18th century Europe shows not only a large-scale
   shift in taste, but also marks the end of poetic rules based on the
   Latin canon and their whole concept of literature. The new (Greek) epic
   ideal in the German- and English-speaking countries is in a productive
   competition with the new form of the novel, as will be shown. The
   reading of the novel with its mobilisation of the senses - the
   imagination - is in turn significant for the concept of the epic. In
   both cases the imagination of individual fates and past, symbolically
   closed cultural areas comes from the same source, which makes them into
   competitors at the book market. These shifts and rivalries have
   developed with greater clarity since the publication of Thomas
   Black-well's ``An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer{''} (1735)
   and can be traced right up to the present day.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical directions are often used and coded as cultural and
   axiological concepts, denominating a cer-tain culture's place and rank
   in the global or regional sphere to which it belongs. Besides, most
   cultures can be subdivided, in geographical regions and develop specific
   images of their `own South'. In Russia the word `South' geographically
   means the Southern regions of the Ukraine, the Black Sea and the
   Caucasus. The Soviet poet Nikolaj Zabolockij (1903-1958), born and bred
   in North Russia and Leningrad, usually encodes the regions of Northern
   and Central Russia in his poetical works. Only after his release from
   imprisonment in-forced labour camps in the year 1945, did he gain the
   opportunity to frequently visit the Russian South, i. e. Georgia, the
   Crimea and Sochi. These visits are closely connected with his
   translations of Georgian poetry, with official and inofficial meetings
   in the Georgian Writers' Union and with his cures in the local.
   sanatoria. Since 1947 the South, especially Georgia, begins to play a
   major role in his work and undergoes a complex development in accordance
   with the political changes up until 1956. Zabolockij depicts his `South'
   as a refuge, as a land of recreation and wellbeing, of his rebirth as
   poet and man, and at the same time as a land burdened with memories of
   the imprisonment and forcible death of poets and the menacing evil of
   Sta-lin's shadow. This South is far from an idyll, and it is never
   presented as a `home country'. On the contrary, Zabolockij stresses the
   mutual `strangeness' of Northern and Southern landscape and life
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Eugene Savitzkaya, the Belgian writer of Ukrainian origin, was born in
   1955 and lives today in Belgium. He has published several novels and
   collections of poetry at Editions Minuit and in 1977 wrote a short novel
   entitled Mentir. The work - said to have been written from photographs
   of the author's mother - is a series of fragmented scenes and
   descriptions that detail the words and movements of the mother of an
   unidentified narrator. The father is curiously absent from this family
   romance. Yet his glaring absence occupies a fundamental ``place{''} in
   the narrative. I will show how a silent paternal signifier establishes
   itself as the cause of the enunciator's problematic relationship with
   his utterances, affecting also the relationship of the subject to the
   story he attempts to construct. I begin by describing the Oedipal desire
   - the narrator's attachment to the mother - that circulates in the text
   through ambiguities in narrative time and changes in the position of the
   narrator's gaze and subjectivity. I suggest that a paternal metaphor
   establishes itself in the text as a force that forbids the subject's
   incestuous desire for the mother, the metaphor taking shape through the
   nightmarish image of a black panther. Yet the unstable relationship of
   the narrator to his narrative - the contradictions, uncertainties,
   obsessive lists and details - evokes the paternal deficiency that cannot
   be filled. The text is read then as the subject's confrontation and
   struggle with castration, desire and the law of the father.}},
