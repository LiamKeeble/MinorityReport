   A case of accusative/dative syncretism?}},

Abstract = {{One of the most characteristic features of the grammar of the
   Lindisfarne Gospel gloss is the absence of the etymological -e
   inflection in the dative singular in the paradigm of the strong
   masculine and neuter declension (a-stems). Ross (1960:38) already noted
   that endingless forms of the nominative/accusative cases were quite
   frequent in contexts where a dative singular in -e would be expected, to
   the extent that he labeled the forms in -e `rudimentary dative.' The aim
   of this article is to assess to what extent the dative singular is still
   found as a separate case in the paradigms of the masculine and neuter
   a-stems and root nouns. To this end a quantitative/statistical analysis
   of nouns belonging to these classes has been carried out in contexts
   where the Latin lemma is either accusative or dative. We have tried to
   determine whether variables such as syntactic context, noun class, and
   frequency condition the presence or absence of the -e inflection, and
   whether the distribution of the inflected and uninflected forms is
   different in the various demarcations that have been identified in the
   gloss. The data have been retrieved using the Dictionary of Old English
   Corpus. All tokens have been checked against the facsimile edition and
   the digitised manuscript in order to detect possible errors.}},

Abstract = {{Debate continues over what was spoken in Britain before, during and
   after it was settled by the Anglo-Saxons in the middle of the first
   millennium ad. Schrijver (2009) argues that phonological and phonetic
   developments in Old English provide vital clues. Accordingly, Old
   English changed in different ways from other Germanic languages due to
   contact with an early British Celtic variety that resembled Old Irish.
   Aspects of this proposal have been greeted with a degree of interest and
   approval by linguists but have escaped detailed review. This article
   argues instead that the Old English developments are closely aligned to
   those found in other Germanic languages. It also includes novel research
   results which explain the variation in late Northumbrian Old English and
   spellings on (morpho)phonological grounds, showing that this alternation
   too provides no evidence for Celtic influence.}},

Abstract = {{In Old English, /-n/ loss started in early Northumbrian and spread to
   the southern dialects after about 1050. An important diagnostic of the
   transition to Middle English, the loss is commonly assumed to be
   morphologically driven. However, /-n/ loss in atonic syllables could
   also be phonologically-conditioned: aweg `away' < onweg, abutan `about'<
   onbutan. In Middle English, the loss proceeded rapidly, but the triggers
   behind the different rates of change and the different results for the
   various categories have not been fully explored. Using LAEME, we survey
   all attestations of /-n/loss, enriching the empirical data-base on the
   change. The findings show significant differences within word-classes,
   and differences between inflectional and derivational suffixes. This
   raises a set of theoretical questions: why did only /-n/inflections lose
   their codas, why was the productivity of verbal derivational /-n/
   phonotactically restricted, what justifies the loss or retention of /-n/
   in stems? We look into the interplay of phonological and morphological
   factors, isolate the sets in which the results appear to be
   phonotactically driven, and address the phonotactic dimension in
   relation to other factors, both within and above the word level. In noun
   plurals, /-n/ loss emerges as the clearest case of avoidance of
   phonotactically suboptimal sequences at the word level. A statistical
   comparison of the end-points of the change reveals that overall
   frequency has stayed constant and has no obvious direct bearing on the
   process, while the presence of /-n/ as a morphological marker has
   changed significantly. The paper ends by identifying aspects of the
   history of /-n/ that remain uncharted.}},

Abstract = {{The subject and adjacency effects found to condition the distribution of
   present verbal morphology in northern Middle English, and commonly
   referred to as the Northern Subject Rule (NSR), are generally regarded
   to be an Early Middle English development that did not condition the
   distribution of verbal morphology in northern varieties of Old English
   (Isaac 2003; Pietsch 2005; de Haas 2008; de Haas \& van Kemenade 2015).
   Using data taken from the tenth-century interlinear gloss to the
   Lindisfarne Gospels, this study considers variation between the
   present-tense markers -o and -s in Late Old Northumbrian and discusses
   evidence which indicates that the subject and adjacency effects at the
   crux of the NSR were already operative in Old Northumbrian with
   different morphological material. The findings also debunk the
   traditional conviction that -s spread first to second-person plural
   contexts and only subsequently to the third-person plural and singular
   (Holmqvist 1922; Blakeley 1949/50; Stein 1986).}},

Volume = {{72}},

Pages = {{245-272}},
Abstract = {{Aldred's interlinear glosses added to the Latin text of the Lindisfarne
   Gospels have undoubtedly an inestimable value as one of the most
   substantial representatives of late Old Northumbrian. Therefore, they
   have been an object of study both as a source of information on this Old
   English variety and on the typological changes affecting Middle English.
   Starting from the assumption that glosses have an ancillary function
   with respect to the Latin text they accompany, I have argued in the
   present paper that they can make a significant contribution to
   delineating the history and meaning of a word inasmuch as glossators
   could have chosen vernacular words according to their core meaning. The
   particular case of the verbs of possession agan and the forms derived
   from it, including the past participle agen, will be used in the
   following discussion of the role of glosses: the investigation of their
   meaning in the Lindisfarne Gospels will help us understand the
   development of agen into the PDE attributive intensifier own.}},

Pages = {{57-75}},

Abstract = {{Old English has traditionally been considered a period of linguistic
   homogeneity, since most available recorded texts are generally written
   in the West Saxon dialect. There are, however, isolated texts which have
   been ascribed to other varieties, in particular Northumbrian and
   Mercian. In fact, recent research on syntactic dialectology in early
   English (Kroch \& Taylor 1997; Ogura 1999; Hogg 2004,2006a; Ingham 2006)
   shows that linguistic variation has been present in the English language
   from the earliest times. This study reassesses the existence of
   variation in the syntax of texts belonging to different dialectal
   varieties in Old English, in particular in relative constructions. Based
   on an analysis of relative clauses in three versions of the Gospels from
   late Old English, representing West Saxon, Northumbrian and Mercian
   dialects, we will observe differences in the texts, regarding both the
   paradigm of relativizers and the position adopted by the relative clause
   within the main clause. I relate these differences to the existence of
   linguistic differences in northern and southern dialects.}},
