Title = {{Many ways of measuring: a scoping review of measurement instruments for
   use with people with aphasia}},
Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Background
   In clinical practice and in research, aphasia measurement instruments
   are used for many reasons: to screen and diagnose, to identify deficits
   and strengths, and to measure outcomes. A proliferation in available
   measurement instruments presents challenges to both the aphasia
   clinician and researcher and forms a barrier to optimal practice. There
   is a need for a comprehensive review of measurement instruments to
   identify the diversity of constructs measured by available tools and
   their cultural and linguistic applicability to the international aphasia
   community.
   Aims
   (1) To identify all available standardised measurement instruments which
   have been developed or tested with people with aphasia; and (2) To
   describe the construct/s measured, method of report, structure
   (components and scoring system), and availability of cultural/linguistic
   adaptations, of identified instruments.
   Methods and Procedures
   This scoping review is reported in alignment with the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for
   Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies were identified through searches
   of PUBMED, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Secondary searches of
   individual measurement instruments and hand searching were also
   undertaken. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and
   full-text articles. Inclusion criteria: studies reporting psychometric
   properties of measurement instruments, participants with aphasia (or
   their proxies), English language full-text journal articles. Data
   extracted: purpose, structure, and method of report of each instrument.
   The construct(s) reported to be measured by each instrument was
   classified according to the International Classification of Functioning,
   Disability and Health (ICF).
   Outcomes and Results
   A total of 3642 articles were identified through database searches.
   Following the removal of duplicates, 2879 articles were screened by
   title and abstract; with 334 articles undergoing full-text review.
   Secondary searches of individual measurement instruments and hand
   searching identified a further 99 publications. In total, 284 references
   for 143 measurement instruments were included in this review.
   Measurement instruments were classified by ICF component; the majority
   were reported to be measures of Body Functions (n = 94); followed by
   Activity/Participation (n = 23); Environmental Factors (n = 5); and
   quality of life/other constructs not within the ICF (n = 16). Five
   measured multiple ICF components.
   Conclusions and Implications
   This review identified 143 measurement instruments, developed or tested
   with people with aphasia. Classified according to the ICF, these
   instruments primarily measure Body Functions (n = 94). Some measurement
   instruments have undergone extensive cultural and linguistic
   translation/adaptation, however most have not. The resulting corpus of
   instruments provides a basis for the selection of measurement
   instruments in clinical and research settings.}},

Abstract = {{There is a well-established relationship between temperature and
   mortality, with older individuals being most at risk in high-income
   settings. This raises the question of the degree to which lives are
   being shortened by exposure to heat or cold. Years of life lost (YLL)
   take into account population life expectancy and age at which mortality
   occurs. However, YLL are rarely used as an outcome-metric in studies of
   temperature-related mortality. This represents an important gap in
   knowledge; to better comprehend potential impacts of temperature in the
   context of climate change and an ageing population, it is important to
   understand the relationship between temperature and YLL, and also
   whether the risks of temperature related mortality and YLL have changed
   over recent years.
   Gridded temperature data derived from observations, and mortality data
   were provided by the UK Met Office and the Office for National
   Statistics (ONS), respectively. We derived YLL for each death using
   sex-specific yearly life expectancy from ONS English-national
   lifetables. We undertook an ecological time-series regression analysis,
   using a distributed-lag double-threshold model, to estimate the
   relationship between daily mean temperature and daily YLL and mortality
   between 1996 and 2013 in Greater London, the West Midlands including
   Birmingham, and Greater Manchester. Temperature-thresholds, as
   determined by model best fit, were set at the 91st (for heat-effects)
   and 35th (for cold-effects) percentiles of the mean temperature
   distribution. Secondly, we analysed whether there had been any changes
   in heat and cold related risk of YLL and mortality over time.
   Heat-effects (lag 0-2 days) were greatest in London, where for each 1
   degrees C above the heat-threshold the risk of mortality increased by
   3.9\% (CI 3.5\%, 4.3\%) and YLL increased by 3.0\% (2.5\%, 3.5\%).
   Between 1996 and 2013, the proportion of total deaths and YLL
   attributable to heat in London were 0.50\% and 0.40\% respectively.
   Cold-effects (lag 0-27 days) were greatest in the West Midlands, where
   for each 1 degrees C below the cold-threshold, risk of mortality
   increased by 3.1\% (2.4\%, 3.7\%) and YLL also increased by 3.1\%
   (2.2\%, 3.9\%). The proportion of deaths and YLL attributable to cold in
   the West Midlands were 3.3\% and 3.2\% respectively. We found no
   evidence of decreasing susceptibility to heat and cold over time.
   The addition of life expectancy information into calculations of
   temperature-related risk and mortality burdens for English cities is
   novel. We demonstrate that although older individuals are at greatest
   risk of temperature-related mortality, heat and cold still make a
   significant contribution to the YLL due to premature death.}},

Title = {{Repair of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Stromal Cell
   Administration in COVID-19 (REALIST-COVID-19): A structured summary of a
   study protocol for a randomised, controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of
   a single intravenous infusion of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in
   patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to
   COVID-19. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of MSCs on
   important clinical outcomes, as described below.Trial designREALIST
   COVID 19 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple blinded
   trial.ParticipantsThe study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in
   hospitals across the United Kingdom. Patients with moderate to severe
   ARDS as defined by the Berlin definition, receiving invasive mechanical
   ventilation and with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical diagnosis
   or PCR test will be eligible.Patients will be excluded for the following
   reasons: more than 72 hours from the onset of ARDS; age < 16 years;
   patient known to be pregnant; major trauma in previous 5 days; presence
   of any active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer); WHO
   Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; venous thromboembolism currently
   receiving anti-coagulation or within the past 3 months; patient
   receiving extracorporeal life support; severe chronic liver disease
   (Child-Pugh > 12); Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place;
   treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; prisoners; declined
   consent; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately
   understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is
   available; previously enrolled in the REALIST trial.Intervention and
   comparatorIntervention: Allogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical
   cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as
   sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension of a fixed dose of 400
   x10(6) cells in 40ml volume, to be diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total
   volume of 200mls for administration.Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte
   148 Solution for Infusion (200mls).The cellular product (REALIST
   ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics.Main
   outcomesThe primary safety outcome is the incidence of serious adverse
   events. The primary efficacy outcome is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7.
   Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and 14; respiratory compliance,
   driving pressure and PaO2/FiO(2) ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14;
   Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14;
   extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration
   of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and
   90-day mortality.RandomisationAfter obtaining informed consent, patients
   will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or
   web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised
   Trials, University of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by
   recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated
   to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio.Blinding
   (masking)The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site
   research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy
   facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate
   intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will
   keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be
   masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked
   infusion set.Numbers to be randomised (sample size)A sample size of 60
   patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the
   control group.
   If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide
   more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients
   recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data
   monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC).Trial statusREALIST Phase 1
   completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an
   open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with
   ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned to
   commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2
   trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and
   approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC. Submissions
   were made to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and MHRA to amend the
   protocol to a COVID-19 specific patient population and the protocol
   amendment was accepted by the REC on 27(th) March 2020 and MHRA on
   30(th) March 2020 respectively. Other protocol changes in this amendment
   included an increase in the time of onset of ARDS from 48 to 72 hours,
   inclusion of clinical outcomes as secondary outcomes, the provision of
   an option for telephone consent, an indicative sample size and provision
   to continue recruitment beyond this indicative sample size. The current
   protocol in use is version 4.0 23.03.2020 (Additional file 1). Urgent
   Public Health status was awarded by the NIHR on 2 April 2020 and the
   trial opened to recruitment and recruited the first participant the same
   day. At the time of publication the trial was open to recruitment at 5
   sites across the UK (Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, King's
   College London, Guys and St Thomas' Hospital London, Birmingham
   Heartlands Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham) and 12
   patients have been recruited across these sites. Additional sites are
   planned to open and appropriate approvals for these are being obtained.
   It is estimated recruitment will continue for 6 months.Trial

Abstract = {{Eighteenth-century punch-cutting was not only difficult to execute, it
   was also difficult to document, therefore, knowledge of early
   typographic practices is generally limited. Fortunately, the punches of
   one of the century's foremost English printers, John Baskerville
   (1707-75), still survive as the primary evidence of craftsmanship and
   the punch-cutters skill and the means of their manufacture. This article
   looks at what is known and, more importantly, what is not known about
   the processes, materials and techniques employed in the manufacture of
   Baskerville's punches. It presents a pilot project designed to explore
   new methodological approaches to describing and analysing this important
   typographical material. It also suggests how the methodology can be
   applied in order to enhance our understanding of Baskerville beyond his
   books.}},

Title = {{The impact of a computerised decision support system on antibiotic usage
   in an English hospital}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Background Antimicrobial resistance is correlated with the inappropriate
   use of antibiotics. Computerised decision support systems may help
   practitioners to make evidence-based decisions when prescribing
   antibiotics. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of
   computerized decision support systems on the volume of antibiotics used.
   Setting A very large 1200-bed teaching hospital in Birmingham, England.
   Main outcome measure The primary outcome measure was the defined daily
   doses/1000 occupied bed-days. Method A retrospective longitudinal study
   was conducted to examine the impact of computerised decision support
   systems on the volume of antibiotic use. The study compared two periods:
   one with computerised decision support systems, which lasted for 2 years
   versus one without which lasted for 2 years after the withdrawal of
   computerised decision support systems. Antibiotic use data from June
   2012 to June 2016 were analysed (comprising 2 years with computerised
   decision support systems immediately followed by 2 years where
   computerised decision support systems had been withdrawn). Regression
   analysis was applied to assess the change in antibiotic consumption
   through the period of the study. Result From June 2012 to June 2016,
   total antibiotic usage increased by 13.1\% from 1436 to 1625 defined
   daily doses/1000 bed-days: this trend of increased antibiotic
   prescribing was more pronounced following the withdrawal of structured
   prescribing (computerised decision support systems). There was a
   difference of means of - 110.14 defined daily doses/1000 bed days of the
   total usage of antibiotics in the period with and without structured
   prescribing, and this was statistically significant (p = 0.026). From
   June 2012 to June 2016, the dominant antibiotic class used was
   penicillins. The trends for the total consumption of all antibiotics
   demonstrated an increase of use for all antibiotic classes except for
   tetracyclines, quinolones, and anti-mycobacterial drugs, whereas
   aminoglycoside usage remained stable. Conclusion The implementation of
   computerised decision support systems appears to influence the use of
   antibiotics by reducing their consumption. Further research is required
   to determine the specific features of computerised decision support
   systems, which influence increased higher adoption and uptake of this
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{The arrival of sound on British cinema screens is perhaps more
   accurately described as the arrival of American sounds. Almost
   overnight, the sounds of American voices, accents, slang and vernacular
   became commonplace throughout the country. This article uses linguistic
   and social economic frameworks to explore the ways in which American
   sound films challenged the legitimacy and dominance of hegemonic forms
   of language within Britain. Taking the mainstream provincial press as a
   primary source, it discusses the ways in which the arrival of sound was
   seen as a nationalist threat to both industry and culture. The article
   uses Birmingham as a focal point and uncovers nuanced ways in which
   language was negotiated and deployed both by mainstream institutions as
   well as young people and the working classes. It argues that dominant
   social actors within British society-such as the press, the Church and
   educationists-saw talkies as almost invariably threatening, while
   marginalised social actors like children, teenagers and working-class
   Northern and Midland audiences were able to use the othered displacement
   of American talkies as a class-neutral space where their own social
   capital was bolstered.}},

Title = {{What have we learnt from measles outbreaks in 3 English cities? A
   qualitative exploration of factors influencing vaccination uptake in
   Romanian and Roma Romanian communities}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background Since 2016, large scale measles outbreaks have heavily
   affected countries across Europe. In England, laboratory confirmed
   measles cases increased almost four-fold between 2017 and 2018, from 259
   to 966 cases. Several of the 2017-18 measles outbreaks in England
   particularly affected Romanian and Roma Romanian communities, with the
   first outbreaks in these communities occurring in Birmingham, Leeds and
   Liverpool. This study explored factors influencing vaccination
   behaviours amongst Romanian and Roma Romanian communities in these three
   cities. Methods Across Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, we conducted
   semi-structured interviews with 33 key providers to explore their
   experience in delivering vaccinations and managing the outbreak
   response. We also interviewed 9 Romanian women in one of the cities to
   explore their vaccination attitudes and behaviours. To categorise
   factors affecting vaccination we applied the 5As Taxonomy for
   Determinants of Vaccine Uptake (Access, Affordability, Awareness,
   Acceptance and Activation) during data analysis. Results Factors related
   to access and acceptance, such as language and literacy, ease of
   registering with a general practice, and trust in health services, were
   reported as the main barriers to vaccination amongst the communities.
   Concerns around vaccination safety and importance were reported but
   these appeared to be less dominant contributing factors to vaccination
   uptake. The active decline of vaccinations amongst interviewed community
   members was linked to distrust in healthcare services, which were partly
   rooted in negative experiences of healthcare in Romania and the UK.
   Conclusion Access and acceptance, dominant barriers to vaccination, can
   be improved through the building of trust with communities. To establish
   trust providers must find ways to connect with and develop a greater
   understanding of the communities they serve. To achieve this, cultural
   and linguistic barriers need to be addressed. Better provider-service
   user relationships are crucial to reducing vaccination inequalities and
   tackling broader disparities in health service access.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses regional governance and the relationship between
   spaces of economic governance and notions of regional economy. The
   region's prominence in state spatial strategy has run alongside
   tendencies for spatial reform in pursuit of optimum spatial articulation
   of economy. Ongoing spatial reform holds implications for structural
   interpretation, policy priority and intervention practice. To this
   extent, regional governance can be understood using a periodisation
   approach, a response framed through specific temporal arrangements
   influenced by preceding actions, approaches and outcomes. Such changes
   however do not occur in isolation of prior spatial iterations,
   presenting both regional demarcation and practice as a dynamic process.
   This process involves three concurrent episodes of structuring, casting
   and disruption, creating a periodisation framework. Focusing on the
   English region of Greater Birmingham and Solihull and its Southern
   Staffordshire sub-region, I discuss the evolution of regional governance
   arrangements and through these interpretation and reflection of regional
   economic structure. I argue periodisation occurs not in punctuated forms
   but as a dynamic and historically founded relationship influencing
   reform, appropriating policy, and selectively interpreting structure for
   organisational interest. These complex relationships create a form of
   tidal heating through which regions are in a state of constant flux.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines diasporic language ecology based on a
   sociolinguistic study of a Chinese complementary school (CCS) in
   Birmingham, England. The study applies a historical perspective to
   investigate local multilingual practices in relation to language
   ideology and identity. The discussion in this paper draws on
   heteroglossia to investigate language stratification in the CCS. It
   documents the impact of global mobility and socio-economic changes on
   shifting power relations among two Chinese language varieties (Putonghua
   and Cantonese) and English. Data for the discussion includes
   audio-recordings of interaction and interview as well as fieldnote
   vignettes. Findings show that (1) a stratified ideological ecology
   including `separate bilingualism', `translanguaging', `a preferred
   school-wide monolingualism', and `a standard language ideology' is
   dynamically constructed and negotiated in the school as a local
   heteroglossia; (2) At the intra-Chinese level, the Chinese language
   shift from Cantonese to Putonghua at global level is seeing its power in
   the local discourses of Putonghua becoming `the new diasporic standard'.
   This standardisation towards Putonghua, on one hand, is claimed and
   celebrated in the school by some Putonghua-speaking members as
   `practical' and `useful' for better communication; on the other side, it
   is also contested - sometimes silently - in tension-filled local
   interactions by groups of Chinese people who lack the resource of
   Putonghua in their repertoires. This complex and tension-filled
   standardisation of diasporic Chinese language provides new local
   discourses of global mobility and the ongoing conversion from linguistic
   standardisation to social inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Life-space mobility (LSM) is a concept for assessing patterns of
   functional mobility over time. LSM is gaining traction in the research
   of geriatric population health. Several instruments have been developed
   to measure LSM, such as the University of Alabama at Birmingham
   Life-Space Assessment (LSA) or the Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter
   instrument. There has been exponential growth in the use of instruments
   measuring LSM in studies of older adults since the concept was
   introduced in 1985. In response to the increased volume of publications
   with clinical applicability to those working in geriatric health or
   conducting population-based research in older adults, we conducted a
   narrative review: a) to provide a summary of the articles that have
   assessed validation of the University of Alabama at Birmingham LSA
   instrument, the most widely used instrument to assess LSM in older
   adults; and b) to provide a summary of the research articles that have
   examined LSM as independent or outcome variable. Studies for this review
   were obtained with an organized search format and were included if they
   were published in the past 20 years, written in English, published in
   peer reviewed literature, and included LSM as an independent or outcome
   variable. Seventy-nine articles were identified: 36 that employed a
   cross-sectional design and 22 that employed a longitudinal/prospective
   design to examine LSM as outcome variable; 17 longitudinal/prospective
   design articles that examined LSM as primary independent variable; 3
   review articles; and 1 systematic review. Areas of research included
   physical function, cognitive function, sensory impairment, mental
   health, falls, frailty, comorbidities, healthcare use, mortality, and
   social/environmental factors. These studies showed that LSM instruments
   can accurately predict morbidity, mortality, and healthcare use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper's theme is the construction of the Amsterdam Crystal Palace
   (Paleis voor Volksvlijt), an exhibition building inspired by London's
   Crystal Palace. The Amsterdam palace was built between 1858 and 1864
   only to burn to the ground in 1929. Although during and after
   construction the initiators took pains to make it look like a product of
   Dutch industry, it could not have been built without English input.
   Architect Cornelis Outshoorn and the initiators did not reveal that they
   had called on London-based engineers Rowland Mason Ordish and William
   Henry Le Feuvre for the structural calculations. The iron for the main
   structure also came from England: from foundries in York and Birmingham.
   Dutch foundries only joined in immediately prior to completion of the
   main structure, making it look as if the Amsterdam building was a
   product of Dutch industry. Due to Cornelis Outshoorn's ill-considered
   design, construction in Amsterdam took no less than six years. The
   preserved ironwork specifications, which total some 55 pages, provide
   insight into the complicated construction concept, which consisted of
   many unique components. As a result, serial production was impossible.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2016, the European Region has experienced large-scale measles
   outbreaks. Several measles outbreaks in England during 2017/18
   specifically affected Romanian and Romanian Roma communities. In this
   qualitative interview study, we looked at the effectiveness of outbreak
   responses and efforts to promote vaccination uptake amongst these
   underserved communities in three English cities: Birmingham, Leeds and
   Liverpool. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 33
   providers involved in vaccination delivery and outbreak management in
   these cities. Interviews were analysed thematically and factors that
   influenced the effectiveness of responses were categorised into five
   themes: (1) the ability to identify the communities, (2) provider
   knowledge and understanding of the communities, (3) the co-ordination of
   response efforts and partnership working, (4) links to communities and
   approaches to community engagement and (5) resource constraints. We
   found that effective partnership working and community engagement were
   key to the prevention and management of vaccine-preventable disease
   outbreaks in the communities. Effective engagement was found to be
   compromised by cuts to public health spending and services for
   underserved communities. To increase uptake in under-vaccinated
   communities, local knowledge and engagement are vital to build trust and
   relationships. Local partners must work proactively to identify,
   understand and build connections with communities.}},

Abstract = {{In the XXI century, a strategic approach to the management of individual
   territories development is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. The
   creation of scenarios and targets for large urban agglomerations is the
   most difficult aspect of strategic planning, as the complex structure of
   economy and social relations generates a variety of interests of
   different population groups. For such territories, it is inadvisable to
   use a unified planning template, because the conditions and demands of
   local communities require individual planning process and approaches. In
   this context, we decided to compare the development strategies of the
   Russian city Ekaterinburg and the English city Birmingham. Firstly, they
   have similar industrial, social and cultural, and demographic
   characteristics. Secondly, both cities strategic development plans are
   aimed at increasing their individualization. We demonstrate the
   necessity and feasibility of individual city development strategies,
   suggesting a methodology for its creation. Development strategies vary
   depending on technological and social progress. While technological
   progress increases the productive forces of cities, social progress
   ensures individualization of their development strategies by creating
   specific mentality, sociocultural, ethical and other values. We
   hypothesise that individual city development strategies depend on the
   territorial specificity of social progress, based on the needs of a
   city's residents. Thus, the emergence of new needs requires updated
   strategies, adjusting resources in accordance with these new needs.
   Based on the study and comparison of strategic plans of two cities, we
   have suggested methodological approaches to the individualization and
   implementation of city development strategies. We have determined a
   system of measures ensuring individualization. It includes the
   establishment of a list of needs, an analysis of the structure and
   volume of resources, as well as of the ways to satisfy specific needs
   for achieving the selected goal. For updating a strategy, it is
   necessary to consider both growing needs and resources to satisfy them.
   We have concluded that the individualization of city development
   strategies improves itself through its implementation and focus on
   satisfying the needs of a specific community, which depend on the
   characteristics of its social progress. We have proved that the
   mentality of residents and their social imprinting greatly influence the
   individualization of cities and their strategies. The scientific,
   technological and sociocultural progress increase the individuality of a
   city. The research results can be used by public authorities and local
   governments while creating and implementing strategic development

Title = {{The introduction of the IBD Disk in Poland - a new tool for assessing

Abstract = {{Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of
   the gastrointestinal tract, which can significantly deteriorate everyday
   functioning. We are, however, still lacking simple methods to assess the
   influence of IBD on patients' disability. IBD Disk is a new graphical
   tool that allows for a quick assessment of the influence of IBD on
   different aspects of everyday life.
   Aim: To present the adaptation process of the IBD Disk in Poland.
   Material and methods: The Polish IBD Working Group together with the
   Institute of Translational Medicine in Birmingham (United Kingdom) and a
   professional translational agency performed a translation and
   re-translation of the Polish version of the IBD Disk. After full
   agreement was achieved, the final Polish version was accepted. In the
   next step, its understandability and ease of use was assessed by using a
   semiquantitative scale (scale from 1 to 10, where ``1{''} means very
   easy to use, ``10{''} means - very difficult to use).
   Results: In the initial translation phase, the concordance between
   translation agency and experts was very high. In the re-translation
   phase only some stylistic and grammatical corrections were made. In the
   final step the general assessment of understandability of all items of
   the tool was high. Moreover, patients with IBD assessed the ease of use
   of the IBD Disk as very easy (median: 1.5 points, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.0-2.0).
   Conclusions: The Polish adaptation of IBD Disk directly reflects the
   original English version. Thus, it can be further used in the validation
   process among Polish IBD patients.}},

Abstract = {{This article utilises English professional football club Birmingham City
   FC as a case study to examine the place of football within the
   globalised economy. In October 2009, the Hong Kong based businessman
   Carson Yeung led a takeover of Birmingham City (BCFC). The Birmingham
   International Holdings (BIH) group that he led aimed to develop the
   club's business profile and support in China by importing Chinese
   players to BCFC and signing deals with Chinese companies. Yeung was
   arrested and charged with money laundering in 2011, and was unable to
   directly fund the club he bought. BCFC were negatively affected by many
   of the decisions made during Yeung's reign. The case study analyses the
   consequences of poor planning for a football club in the globalised
   economy. It utilises the ideas of Appadurai on globalisation, and
   examines how the business of football exemplifies what Appadurai terms
   the mysterious and complex nature of global capital.}},

Title = {{Governing and contesting marginality: Muslims and urban governance in
   the UK}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Sites of Muslim settlement in the UK are frequently portrayed as poorly
   integrated and governed areas - a situation that is often attributed to
   the excessive cultural and religious accommodation of Muslim minorities
   under flawed policies of state multiculturalism. Through a case study of
   an English city, Birmingham, home to the UK's largest Muslim population
   outside of London, I argue that sites of Muslim settlement have, rather,
   been subject to extraordinary and punitive governing practices. These
   governing practices moreover rely for their legitimacy on the portrayal
   of these sites as poorly integrated and governed. Nevertheless, whilst
   areas of Muslim settlement have been subject to spatially focused,
   punitive forms of governance, these have not necessarily been fully
   coherent and they have also been contested.}},

Title = {{Understanding the lived experiences of severe postnatal psychiatric
   illnesses in English speaking South Asian women, living in the UK: a
   qualitative study protocol}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction The South Asian population is the UK's largest and fastest
   growing minority ethnic group. There is evidence to suggest the lay
   understanding of postnatal psychiatric illnesses of this group may fall
   outside the purview of Western biomedical perspectives. Alternative
   explanations include psychosocial, cultural and spiritual factors.
   Approaching psychiatric illnesses through a social perspective includes
   gaining insight to the patient's subjective experiences and
   understandings via qualitative inquiry. The objectives of this
   qualitative study are to explore South Asian women's narrative of living
   with a severe postnatal psychiatric illness and experiences of Perinatal
   Mental Health Services, care and support.
   Methods and analysis Data collection is ongoing and will continue until
   31 December 2018. Participants will be identified and recruited from
   Perinatal Mental Health Services in Birmingham and London. Eligible
   participants will be English speaking South Asian females aged 18 years
   or above with the capacity to give written informed consent.
   Participants are clinically diagnosed with a severe postnatal
   psychiatric illness. This qualitative study uses individual in-depth
   face-to-face interviews that aim to last 1hour. Interviews will be audio
   recorded with participants' permission. Interview audio recordings will
   be transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative
   phenomenological analysis (IPA). The primary goal of IPA is for the
   researcher to closely study and interpret how individuals make sense of
   their life experiences in a particular context by drawing on the
   fundamental principles of phenomenology, hermeneutics and idiography.
   Ethics and dissemination The University of Birmingham, the South
   Birmingham Research Ethics Committee and the Health Research Authority
   have approved this study (approvals date: 18-12-2017 ref: 17/WM/0350).
   Local capability and capacity have been confirmed from Trust Research
   and Development departments. The researchers plan to publish the results
   from this study in journals and present findings at academic
   conferences.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pre-operative risk factors for post-operative ventilation
   and their influence on survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for
   malignancy are unknown.
   Methods: Totally 391 patients operated in Hannover, Germany were
   investigated with multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression
   modeling to identify independent risk factors for post-operative
   ventilation >= 6h, patient survival and 90-day mortality. And 84
   patients operated in Birmingham, United Kingdom were analyzed to assess
   the external relevance of findings.
   Results: Longer operations, history of thrombosis, intra-operative blood
   transfusion, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and
   higher values of the age at operation divided by the Horovitz Quotient
   independently increased the risk of post-operative ventilation >= 6h in
   German patients (n = 108; 27.6\%) (P<0.050). Blood transfusion and lower
   pre-operative eGFR levels increased the risk of early death in German
   patients significantly and independently of established prognostic
   factors. A history of thrombosis and lower eGFR levels were also
   independent significant risk factors for 90-day mortality in German
   patients but not in English patients. None of the English patients
   received post-operative ventilation. Significantly more German patients
   were >75 years, had a history of thrombosis, received blood
   transfusions, and had significantly worse lung function parameters. pT4
   tumors were detected in 18 German patients (4.6\%), but not in the
   English patients.
   Conclusions: Identified risk factors for post-operative ventilation are
   clinically relevant in Germany but not in England and may be used to
   lower mortality risk. The German and the English cohorts displayed
   significant differences in the approach to patient selection and early
   post-operative extubation. (C) 2019 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang

Abstract = {{Film technology has become an increasingly prominent component of
   theatre design. In the practice of Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage it
   may support what has been described as a `pizza style' of presentation,
   in which disparate techniques and modes of presentation are used to
   disturb conventional ideas of narrative, context, and textual authority,
   while in the work of Motionhouse it creates a language of dance as
   circus. The longstanding collaboration between film designer Ravi
   Deepres and choreographer Wayne McGregor presents an alternative model,
   at once highly composed as narrative and based on meticulous research
   into textual evidence. In this interview with David Roberts, Deepres
   charts the evolution of his work with McGregor up to their award-winning
   Woolf Works, showing how a genuinely collaborative artistic process and
   attention to the graphic possibilities of different film technologies
   have transformed our understanding of the role of design in devised
   performance. Ravi Deepres is Professor of Moving Image and Photography
   at Birmingham City University. For the past nineteen years he has
   designed shows in collaboration with choreographer Wayne McGregor. Their
   most recent success, Woolf Works, won the Olivier Award for Best New
   Dance Production and re-opened at La Scala Milan in April 2019. David
   Roberts is Professor of English at Birmingham City University. His
   recent publications include George Farquhar: A Migrant Life Reversed
   (Bloomsbury, 2018), and he is currently working on a new edition of
   Congreve's The Way of the World.}},

Abstract = {{This special issue of Social Epistemology has its origin in two symposia
   organised by the Contemporary Philosophy of Technology Research Group at
   the University of Birmingham (UK). These were The Digital University in
   a Neoliberal Age' in November 2017 and The Neoliberal Imagination' in
   February 2018. The articles published here explore the relationship
   between neoliberalism, technocracy and technology, with a special but
   not exclusive focus on universities, which are open to contestation
   concerning their role in the public sphere and the politics of knowledge
   production. Where universities are discussed, English higher education
   is focused on, because this is undergoing an intense audit-driven
   neoliberal re-engineering. English higher education is an outlier in
   Europe to the extent to which it has undergone marketisation, with
   top-down reforms imposed by the supposedly rolled back,
   less-interventionist neoliberal state (Shattock, Times Higher,3April
   2019). Central to these are state-imposed technocratic audit regimes
   which are used to provide objective' data on performance', which has,
   always already, to be excellent' (see Readings' 1997 classic critique of
   the vacuity of the notion of excellence'). Before briefly introducing
   each article, we will situate the concerns mentioned above in the
   context of a social epistemological critique of knowledge production.}},

Title = {{Cultural adaptation of a children's weight management programme: Child
   weigHt mANaGement for Ethnically diverse communities (CHANGE) study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Childhood obesity prevalence continues to be at high levels
   in the United Kingdom (UK). South Asian children (mainly Pakistani and
   Bangladeshi origin) with excess adiposity are at particular risk from
   the cardiovascular consequences of obesity. Many community-based
   children's weight management programmes have been delivered in the UK,
   but none have been adapted for diverse cultural communities. The aim of
   the Child weigHt mANaGement for Ethnically diverse communities (CHANGE)
   study, was to culturally adapt an existing children's weight management
   programme for children aged 4-11years so that the programme was more
   able to meet the needs of families from South Asian communities.
   Methods: The adaptation process was applied to First Steps, an evidence
   informed programme being delivered in Birmingham (a large, ethnically
   diverse city). A qualitative study was undertaken to obtain the views of
   South Asian parents of children with excess weight, who had fully or
   partially attended, or who had initially agreed but then declined to
   attend the First Steps programme. The resulting data were integrated
   with current research evidence and local programme information as part
   of a cultural adaptation process that was guided by two theoretical
   frameworks.
   Results: Interviews or focus groups with 31 parents in their preferred
   languages were undertaken. Themes arising from the data included the
   need for convenient timing of a programme in a close familiar location,
   support for those who do not speak English, the need to focus on health
   rather than weight, nutritional content that focuses on traditional and
   Western diets, more physical activity content, and support with
   parenting skills. The data were mapped to the Behaviour Change Wheel
   framework and Typology of Cultural Adaptation to develop an intervention
   programme outline. The research evidence and local programme information
   was then used in the detailed planning of the programme sessions.
   Conclusions: The process of cultural adaptation of an existing
   children's weight management programme resulted in a theoretically
   underpinned programme that is culturally adapted at both the surface and
   deep structural levels.}},

Abstract = {{The 24-week foetus occupies a prominent position in contemporary English
   reproductive politics. It sits on the upper border of the abortion time
   limit (after which terminations can only be performed for medical
   reasons) and the lower border of foetal viability (whereby a premature
   infant has a reasonable chance of survival). As such, the 24-week foetus
   emerges as a locus for diverse ontologies and orientations. Based on
   ethnographic research conducted in London and Birmingham, UK, with
   self-described ``pro-life{''} and ``pro-choice{''} activists, I explore
   the social, material, and interpretive strategies through which
   campaigners with opposing views on abortion construct multiple types of
   24-week foetuses. My analysis examines how abortion activists
   discursively frame these foetal figures, differentially foregrounding
   the biological and the social in their definitions of foetal
   ``reality{''}. In so doing, I argue that these foetuses can be seen as
   products not only of diverse ideologies, but also of diverse
   interpretations of, and responses to, ambiguity, subjectivity, and
   contingency.}},

Abstract = {{Among the many subjects taught at primary, secondary and tertiary
   institutions physical education (PE) has had limited discussion with
   respect to the language of PE. As an examination subject in secondary
   school, physical performance is one key factor leading to success in PE;
   however, PE disciplinary knowledge is often assessed through written or
   spoken texts, resulting in students needing to have both the ability to
   physically perform and the disciplinary literacy required to demonstrate
   knowledge of the subject. The present paper extends the discussion of
   content and language integrated learning (CLIL), by providing a theory
   of language and a pedagogy informed by systemic functional linguistics;
   and investigating the benefits of the explicit teaching of curriculum
   language related to PE in order to prepare students to succeed in PE
   exams. Data including observations and videos of classroom interaction,
   texts written by students and interviews with teachers and students were
   collected at Hamstead Hall Academy, Birmingham, UK, where over 50\% of
   students have English as an additional language. The data were analysed
   to investigate if the explicit teaching of the language of PE had a
   positive impact on both teachers and students. In focussing specifically
   on the language of PE, the teachers became more aware of the role of
   language as meaning making resource, students' written assignments
   improved and overall the PE exam results increased dramatically. These
   findings illustrate the benefit of explicitly teaching discipline
   specific language for curriculum learning, and highlight the language of
   PE, which tends to be a marginalised subject in the discussion of ESP.

Abstract = {{This paper offers a discussion of the political oratory of J. Enoch
   Powell (1912-1998) by focusing on four major speeches: an intervention
   in the House of Commons debate on the Hola Camp affair (July 1959), a
   lecture given at Trinity College Dublin (November 1964), an address to
   the Royal Society of St George in London (April 1964), and the so-called
   `Rivers of Blood speech' (Birmingham, April 1968). Powell was a widely
   sought after speaker, and published ample selections of his speeches in
   volumes that played a significant role in establishing his standing as
   one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of his generation.
   His speeches were not just powerful tools of persuasion and
   consensus-building: they afforded opportunities to articulate weighty
   ideological propositions and were facets of a complex
   self-representation strategy. Before entering politics Powell had been a
   distinguished Hellenist. This study assesses the extent of the classical
   legacy in his speeches, both in formal and ideological terms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first to test an amenity-based sorting model for
   cities in England. We explore household location under both monocentric
   and polycentric assumptions about city structure. On average, we find no
   systematic relationship between income and household distance to the
   city centre. However, there are differences between cities, with a
   positive income-distance relationship in Birmingham and Leeds, and a
   negative relationship in Newcastle. Household heterogeneity is also
   important; for example, on average households with heads who are
   migrants live 25\% closer to the centre than non-migrants. We also find
   that only the employed (and those above the poverty line) are influenced
   by the availability of public transport, which is in direct opposition
   to the US evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The growing demand for high-quality obstetric care and
   treatment has led to the advent and development of a field known as
   obstetric triage. The present review study aimed to examine the
   development of tools and criteria for obstetric triage services.
   Methods: In this narrative review, two authors searched for related
   articles using the keywords of ``obstetric triage, gynecology triage,
   perinatal Triage, maternity triage, midwifery triage{''} AND ``tool,
   index, scale, questionnaire, system{''}. With Persian and English
   language limitation, searches were performed in Scopus, Google Scholar,
   Scientific Information Database, ProQuest, Medline, Embase and Web of
   Science databases for articles published from 2000 to 2018. Results: Out
   of the 289 articles reviewed in this study, 8 articles met the
   eligibility criteria. Out of these 8 articles, 6 were dedicated to
   introducing a tool designed and only 2 introduced an obstetric triage
   system. The obstetric triage tools and systems covered included
   Emergency Severity Index (ESI), Obstetric Triage Acuity Scale (OTAS),
   Birmingham symptom specific obstetric triage system (BSOTS), Maternal
   Fetal Triage Index (MFTI), Florida Hospital Obstetric Triage Acuity
   Tool, self-assessment questionnaire for gynecologic emergencies (SAQ-GE)
   and Perinatal Emergency Team Response Assessment (PETRA). Overall, the
   validity and reliability of the studied method were investigated and
   found to be acceptable in only 5 of the reviewed studies. Conclusion:
   The review showed the lack of consensus on how to devise a single
   standardized tool or system for obstetric triage. The comparison of
   different obstetric triage tools and systems demonstrated the need for a
   standardized and widely-approved system with high validity and
   reliability and standard definitions for obstetric triage to determine
   the right priority and waiting times of obstetric care services.}},

Abstract = {{Using a substantial set of vagrancy removal records for Middlesex
   (1777-86) giving details of the place of origin of some 11,500
   individuals, and analysing these records using a five-variable gravity
   model of migration, this article addresses a simple question: from which
   parts of England did London draw its lower-class migrants in the late
   eighteenth century? It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of
   the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrantscontributing
   relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates
   in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that
   migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West
   Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially
   higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling
   wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel
   network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the
   capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern
   described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers
   of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance
   migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a

Abstract = {{Introduction: Developments in information and communication technologies
   have enabled electronic health and seen a huge expansion over the last
   decade. This has increased the possibility of self-management of health
   issues. Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of the Baby Buddy app on
   maternal self-efficacy and mental well-being three months post-birth in
   a sample of mothers recruited antenatally. In addition, to explore when,
   why and how mothers use the app and consider any benefits the app may
   offer them in relation to their parenting, health, relationships or
   communication with their child, friends, family members or health
   professionals. Methods: We will use a mixed-methods approach, a cohort
   study, a qualitative element and analysis of in-app data. Participants
   will he first-time pregnant women, aged 16 years and over, between 12
   and 16 weeks of gestation and recruited from five English study sites.
   Evaluation plan: We will compare maternal self-efficacy and mental
   health at three months post-delivery in mothers who have downloaded the
   Baby Buddy app compared with those that have not downloaded the app,
   controlling for confounding factors. Women will be recruited antenatally
   between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. Further follow-ups will take place
   at 35 weeks of gestation and three months post-birth. Data from the
   cohort study will be supplemented by in-app data that will include, for
   example, patterns of usage. Qualitative data will assess the impact of
   the app on the lives of pregnant women and health professionals using
   both focus groups and interviews. Ethics: Approval from the West
   Midlands-South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee (NRES) (16/WM/0029)
   and the University of the West of England, Bristol, Research Ethics
   Committee (HAS.16.08.001). Dissemination: Findings of the study will be
   published in peer reviewed and professional journals, presented locally,
   nationally and at international conferences. Participants will receive a
   summary of the findings and the results will be published on Best
   Beginnings' website.}},

Title = {{Spatial distribution of clinical computer systems in primary care in
   England in 2016 and implications for primary care electronic medical
   record databases: a cross-sectional population study}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives UK primary care databases (PCDs) are used by researchers
   worldwide to inform clinical practice. These databases have been
   primarily tied to single clinical computer systems, but little is known
   about the adoption of these systems by primary care practices or their
   geographical representativeness. We explore the spatial distribution of
   clinical computing systems and discuss the implications for the
   longevity and regional representativeness of these resources.
   Design Cross-sectional study.
   Setting English primary care clinical computer systems.
   Participants 7526 general practices in August 2016.
   Methods Spatial mapping of family practices in England in 2016 by
   clinical computer system at two geographical levels, the lower Clinical
   Commissioning Group (CCG, 209 units) and the higher National Health
   Service regions (14 units). Data for practices included numbers of
   doctors, nurses and patients, and area deprivation.
   Results Of 7526 practices, Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) was
   used in 4199 (56\%), SystmOne in 2552 (34\%) and Vision in 636 (9\%).
   Great regional variability was observed for all systems, with EMIS
   having a stronger presence in the West of England, London and the South;
   SystmOne in the East and some regions in the South; and Vision in
   London, the South, Greater Manchester and Birmingham.
   Conclusions PCDs based on single clinical computer systems are
   geographically clustered in England. For example, Clinical Practice
   Research Datalink and The Health Improvement Network, the most popular
   primary care databases in terms of research outputs, are based on the
   Vision clinical computer system, used by <10\% of practices and heavily
   concentrated in three major conurbations and the South. Researchers need
   to be aware of the analytical challenges posed by clustering, and
   barriers to accessing alternative PCDs need to be removed.}},

Abstract = {{The world is undergoing a process of fast and unprecedented
   urbanisation. It is reported that by 2050 66\% of the entire world
   population will live in cities. Although this phenomenon is generally
   considered beneficial, it is also causing housing crises and more
   inequality worldwide. In the past, the relationship between design
   features of cities and socio-economic levels of their residents has been
   investigated using both qualitative and quantitative methods. However,
   both sets of works had significant limitations as the former lacked
   generalizability and replicability, while the latter had a too narrow
   focus, since they tended to analyse single aspects of the urban
   environment rather than a more complex set of metrics. This might have
   been caused by the lack of data availability. Nowadays, though, larger
   and freely accessible repositories of data can be used for this purpose.
   In this paper, we propose a scalable method that delves deeper into the
   relationship between features of cities and socio-economics. The method
   uses openly accessible datasets to extract multiple metrics of urban
   form and then models the relationship between urban form and
   socio-economic levels through spatial regression analysis. We applied
   this method to the six major conurbations (i.e., London, Manchester,
   Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, and Newcastle) of the United Kingdom (UK)
   and found that urban form could explain up to 70\% of the variance of
   the English official socio-economic index, the Index of Multiple
   Deprivation (IMD). In particular, results suggest that more deprived UK
   neighbourhoods are characterised by higher population density, larger
   portions of unbuilt land, more dead-end roads, and a more regular street
   pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Societies rely on trustworthy communication in order to function, and
   the need for trust clearly extends to human-machine communication.
   Therefore, it is essential to design machines to elicit trust, so as to
   make interactions with them acceptable and successful. However, while
   there is a substantial literature on first impressions of
   trustworthiness based on various characteristics, including voice, not
   much is known about the trust development process. Are first impressions
   maintained over time? Or are they influenced by the experience of an
   agent's behaviour? We addressed these questions in three experiments
   using the ``iterated investment game{''}, a methodology derived from
   game theory that allows implicit measures of trust to be collected over
   time. Participants played the game with various agents having different
   voices: in the first experiment, participants played with a computer
   agent that had either a Standard Southern British English accent or a
   Liverpool accent; in the second experiment, they played with a computer
   agent that had either an SSBE or a Birmingham accent; in the third
   experiment, they played with a robot that had either a natural or a
   synthetic voice. All these agents behaved either trustworthily or
   untrustworthily. In all three experiments, participants trusted the
   agent with one voice more when it was trustworthy, and the agent with
   the other voice more when it was untrustworthy. This suggests that
   participants might change their trusting behaviour based on the
   congruency of the agent's behaviour with the participant's first
   impression. Implications for human-machine interaction design are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the systems developed by the University of
   Birmingham for the 2018 CALL Shared Task (ST) challenge. The task is to
   perform automatic assessment of grammatical and linguistic aspects of
   English spoken by German-speaking Swiss teenagers. Our developed systems
   consist of two components, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text
   processing (TP). We explore several ways of building a DNN-HMM ASR
   system using out-of-domain AMI speech corpus plus a limited amount of ST
   data. In development experiments on the initial ST data, our final ASR
   system achieved the word error-rate (WER) of 12.00\%, compared to
   14.89\% for the official ST baseline DNN-HMM system. The WER of 9.28\%
   was achieved on the test set data. For TP component, we first post
   process the ASR output to deal with hesitations and then pass this to a
   template-based grammar, which we expanded from the provided baseline. We
   also developed a TP system based on machine learning methods, which
   enables to better accommodate variability of spoken language. We also
   fused outputs from several systems using a linear logistic regression.
   Our best system submitted to the challenge achieved F-measure of 0.914,
   D of 10.764 and D pat score of 5.691 on the final test set.}},

   of the Godsal bullpup rifle, to describe Godsal rifle 11005 in detail,
   and to follow that rifle's voyage from 1905 Birmingham to 21st century
   Montreal. The general description draws on published articles, patent
   documents, and comparisons to other specific weapons. The detailed
   description of 11005 includes precise measurements (of the entire
   assembly as well as individual pieces after dismantling), comparisons to
   other rifles, and observations noted after cycling through the action of
   the weapon. The voyage of Godsal 11005 is revealed via a series of
   markings found on it, some of which are familiar to the public, some of
   which will be presented and explained in this article.}},

Abstract = {{Corpora have been used in English as a foreign language materials for
   decades, and native corpora have been present in the classroom by means
   of direct approaches such as Data-Driven Learning (Johns, T., and P.
   King 1991. `Should you be Persuaded'- Two Samples of Data-Driven
   Learning Materials. In Classroom Concordancing, 1-16. Birmingham
   University. English Language Research Journal 4.). However, the
   suitability of using learners' output in classroom tasks remains
   controversial. This paper describes a pilot study in the application of
   a non-standard direct approach where Spanish university students are
   invited to reflect on their production. In the experiment, carried out
   in several sessions during the course, the students were exposed to a
   selection of erroneous sentences from their compositions. Prior to the
   classroom activity, the teacher contrasted the learners' sentences with
   correct versions produced by native English speakers. A relevant part of
   the methodology consisted in getting learners collectively involved in
   finding the errors and suggesting improvements. After that, solutions
   were discussed through the analysis of the alternative sentences
   provided by the native students. The results show that students are
   willing to accept this methodology as a supplement to textbooks'
   proposals. We claim that authentic and highly specific learner data
   obtained from a reliable ad hoc learner corpus and direct exposure to
   these data through controlled activities may cover certain learners'
   needs not found in textbooks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the growing field of family language policy by
   considering the life trajectories, language ideologies and linguistic
   investment of two transnational and multilingual families who have moved
   from Timor-Leste to the UK - to Dungannon, Northern Ireland. The paper
   draws on an ethnographic study conducted in Dungannon {[}da Costa
   Cabral, 2010. From Dili to Dungannon: A case study of two bilingual
   migrant families from East-Timor (Unpublished master's thesis).
   University of Birmingham]. The research included participant
   observation, field notes, language diaries, diary-based interviews and
   semi-structured interviews. It took as its starting point the view that
   migrant families are not static, self-contained units. Such families are
   situated within different social and historical contexts, and the
   language ideologies, repertoires and practices of family members are
   shaped by their lived experiences, over time, within these different
   contexts. The key insights gleaned in this study were as follows: The
   parents' beliefs and values regarding the languages in their
   communicative repertoires - Tetum, Portuguese and Indonesian - reflected
   their lived experiences in education and work, at different moments in
   the recent history of Timor-Leste. After moving to Northern Ireland,
   their language ideologies became closely bound up with their aspirations
   for their children. They encouraged their children's learning and use of
   English and did not show a strong commitment to the use of Tetum at
   home.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2014 there have been across Europe programmes of commemorative
   events to mark the Great War, 1914-18, and early amongst these events
   was an exhibition of photographs Paris 14-18, la guerre au quotidien at
   the Galerie des Bibliotheques de la Ville de Paris. The photographs were
   all taken by Charles Lansiaux, and record daily life in the city, from
   the recruitment and departure of French soldiers to victory celebrations
   in 1918. The exhibition importantly pointed to the fact that the Great
   War was the first conflict where the experiences of civilians were
   extensively visually documented. Further, as publicity for the
   exhibition noted: ``La presence recurrente de groupes d'enfants dans ces
   photographies revele la place nouvelle qui leur incombe, a l'aube du xx
   siecle{''}. Taking a lead from this exhibition this paper will
   investigate the wartime experiences of children in one English city,
   namely Birmingham, and how they were visually captured. In particular we
   will focus on documenting and analysing the connections between the
   representation of children at war, propaganda and the promotion of
   patriotism.}},

Abstract = {{In his keynote lecture at the Reimagining Further Education conference
   in Birmingham in June 2016, Sir Frank McLoughlin was clear that the
   sector `needed a mission' to unite around, and to let people know where
   it is going. This was endorsed by the attendees, who felt that it would
   enable the sector to regain ownership of what it stands for nationally,
   regionally and locally. Such a vision is needed to create a Technical
   and Vocational Education and Training sector that is targeted to develop
   an effective shared culture in the further education sector, close
   skills shortages and skills gaps in education, enhance community
   cohesion and improve productivity. This vision needs to have a robust
   measure of impact that aligns with the vision. One possibility is to
   explore a non-financial and intangible value metric where social value
   is aligned to the sector mission. A robust measure will enable key
   stakeholders to agree on areas of focus in a specific geographical
   location or a specific time. Such a measure might challenge the need for
   the existence of regulatory bodies such as Ofsted in the way they
   operate now. With such a robust measure of social value/impact,
   Government will not need to issue a white paper every time a response to
   a localised issue is required. We suggest that the Social Earnings Ratio
   (S/E or SE Ratio) is such a robust measure. For example, if the need in
   a certain locality is to address skills gaps/shortages or to focus on
   community cohesion, all that is needed is a change in the weighting of
   the various components of such a measure. This will allow development of
   a further education mission that can be utilised nationally, regionally
   and locally. In this article, we develop this idea and provide an
   illustration of how the SE Ratio could be applied to a further education
   college. The example we use is that of a small further education college
   with an annual budget of 12 pound m. We demonstrate, using SE Ratio,
   that this college produces an intangible value of approximately 40 pound
   m per annum. Such an approach will enable further education to become
   the strong owner of its mission and vision in the future, and allow it
   to develop its own culture and expertise to the maximum of its
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{The Malvern Festival was established in 1929 by the founder and then
   director of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Sir Barry Jackson. While
   the Festival began as an event solely dedicated to Shaw, Jackson's
   guiding philosophy of the Festival soon changed its direction in later
   seasons as Jackson sought to present a glorified sense of England's past
   to an audience of international visitors by means of an emphasis on
   lesser-known classics in English theater. This article explores the
   reception of Shaw's Too True to Be Good (1932) in this context to argue
   that Shaw's increasingly dystopian visions of England's future as
   depicted in his later plays clashed with Jackson's organization of the
   Festival and that Shaw's inclusion in the repertoire and presence in
   Malvern largely contributed to the Festival's failure in reconciling its
   images of the past and present.}},

Abstract = {{During the Soviet era, there was very limited contact between the rich
   training traditions of Russia and the UK. After the collapse of the
   Soviet Union, mutual exchange became easier. Bella Merlin, for example,
   has documented her difficult but inspiring year at the State Institute
   of Cinematography (VGIK). Merlin's teachers at VGIK influenced a number
   of other English-speaking practitioners at a series of summer schools in
   Birmingham in the mid-1990s. These schools were known as the Russian
   School of Acting'. The senior RSA teacher was Albert Filozov, the
   celebrated actor and People's Artist of Russia, who died in April 2016.
   Steeped in the Russian tradition, Filozov trained at the Moscow Art
   Theatre under Kedrov, and was strongly influenced by Maria Knebel.
   During the first RSA, Filozov was interviewed by three participants,
   Asher Levin, David Jackson and John Albasiny. An edited reconstruction
   of the discussion is published here in Sources' for the first time. The
   introduction summarises Filozov's achievements and contextualises three
   questions he considers which are of particular interest to performance
   training: what is the difference between life and stage emotion, what is
   the relationship between emotion and action and is it possible to teach
   acting at all?}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study aims to highlight problems with recruiting to an
   English stool sample community prevalence study. It was part of a larger
   cross-sectional research to determine the risk factors for the presence
   of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing
   coliforms in stool samples of the asymptomatic general English
   population.
   Setting Four National Health Service primary care trusts (PCTs) of
   England representing a different section of the population of England:
   Newham PCT; Heart of Birmingham Teaching PCT; Shropshire County PCT; and
   Southampton City PCT.
   Participants Sixteen general practices across the four PCTs were
   purposefully selected. After stratification of GP lists by age,
   ethnicity and antibiotic use, 58 337 randomly selected patients were
   sent a postal invitation. Patients who had died, moved to a different
   surgery, were deemed too ill by their General Practitioner or
   hospitalised at the time of mailing were excluded.
   Results Stool and questionnaire returns varied by area, age, gender and
   ethnicity; the highest return rate of 27.3\% was in Shropshire in the
   age group of over 60 years; the lowest, 0.6\%, was in Birmingham in the
   age group of 1839 years. Whereas only 3.9\%(2296) returned a completed
   questionnaire and stool sample, 94.9\% of participants gave permission
   for their sample and data to be used in future research.
   Conclusion Researchers should consider the low stool specimen return
   rate and wide variation by ethnicity and age when planning future
   studies involving stool specimen collection. This is particularly
   pertinent if the study has no health benefit to participants. Further
   research is needed to explore how to improve recruitment in
   multicultural communities and in younger people.}},

Abstract = {{Court interpreters have seldom been featured in studies on the criminal
   courts. Until recently, cases requiring court interpreters were rare and
   marginal. The peculiarity and historical rarity of these cases may
   explain the lack of academic consideration of the work of court
   interpreters in the criminal justice literature. Rapid demographic
   changes brought about by mass migration, however, are changing the
   make-up of criminal justice proceedings, rendering court interpreters
   key participants and inexorable aides for the everyday running of the
   criminal justice system. This article examines the increased reliance on
   interpreters and the nature of their involvement in criminal justice
   proceedings. It will explore the relationship between interpreters and
   defendants, on the one hand, and between interpreters, counsels, and
   judges, on the other. Drawing on empirical data stemming from a research
   project on foreign national defendants conducted in Birmingham's
   criminal courts, we explore issues of trust and reliability underpinning
   the intervention of court interpreters and the implications of these
   interventions for the defendant's case. The use of interpreters aims
   first and foremost to ensure the defendant's right to defense. Yet, as
   we show, their intervention is often propelled or hindered by
   instrumental, procedural, or logistical reasons, intimately linked to
   the rapid transformation of the demography of defendants and the
   privatization of services related to the criminal justice system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on issues at the interface between semantics and
   lexicography that arose out of the data collection and classification of
   vocabulary in Anglo-Norman and Middle English in order to create a
   bilingual thesaurus of everyday life in medieval England. The Bilingual
   Thesaurus project is based at Birmingham City University and the
   University of Westminster. Issues to be resolved included the definition
   of an occupational domain; the creation of a methodology of data
   collection; the delimitation of domain-specific vocabulary; making
   distinctions between sense and usage; and the categorisation of the
   lexical items. Some of these issues are general to thesaurus-making,
   some are specific to the making of historical thesauruses, while some
   are unique to the production of a thesaurus of two languages whose use
   overlapped for several centuries in the late medieval period in England.}},

Abstract = {{Academic, policy and industry debates have tended to focus on the
   mainstream film sector when discussing cultural diversity. One of the
   persistent challenges for the sector has been how to diversify cultural
   representation and participation. This article suggests that
   participatory modes of community filmmaking make an important
   contribution to cultural diversity. Drawing on an evidence base derived
   from qualitative research conducted in three English regions, the
   article shifts the spotlight away from the mainstream and onto the
   margins of the film sector in order to explore more bottom-up'
   approaches to cultural diversity. It examines how community filmmakers
   interpret and engage with questions of cultural diversity and how this
   connects to the participatory and business practices that they adopt.
   The findings highlight the significance of processes of practice in how
   mediated cultural diversity manifests itself and the value of community
   filmmaking in contributing to wider cultural diversity debates and
   practices.}},

   people communicate in superdiverse cities in the UK. In the setting of a
   butcher's stall in a city market we consider three interactions at a
   particular market stall between butchers and their customers. In the
   first, gesture is deployed as a resource by both an English butcher's
   assistant and his customer. In the second, we examine the body as a
   resource in the semiotic repertoire of a Chinese butcher as he
   negotiates a faux haggling interaction with East European customers. In
   the third example, also recorded as field notes, a Chinese woman employs
   a Chinese' gesture to represent the number of pieces of offal she wishes
   to purchase from an English butcher's assistant. Each of the examples
   was recorded during an extended period of ethnographic field work in
   Birmingham Bull Ring market. Through detailed analysis of these
   interactions we argue that when people's biographical and linguistic
   histories barely overlap, they translanguage through the deployment of
   wide-ranging semiotic repertoires.}},

   Conventional great man' and punctuated equilibrium explanations of

   two significant changes in the institutional path of Birmingham City
   Council - the late nineteenth-century municipalisation of private
   providers (gas and water) and the early twenty-first century
   corporatisation of public services (back-office functions, building
   control, educational support, and museums and art galleries). Data are
   drawn from secondary sources including Council documents and
   contemporary accounts. Centrifugal pressure in the early twenty-first
   century result in arm's length companies offering greater financial
   resilience. This contrasts with late nineteenth-century centripetal
   pressure to minimise the patchwork of private providers and trade for a

Journal = {{OPEN LINGUISTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{British Sign Language (BSL) is a visual-gestural language distinct from
   spoken languages used in the United Kingdom but in contact with them.
   One product of this contact is the use of fingerspelling to represent
   English words via their orthography. Fingerspelled loans can become
   ``nativised{''}, adapting manual production to conform more closely to
   the native lexicon's inventory of phonemic constraints. Much of the
   previous literature on fingerspelling has focused on one-handed systems
   but, unlike the majority of sign languages, BSL uses a two-handed manual
   alphabet. What is the nature of nativisation in BSL, and does it exhibit
   sociolinguistic variation? We apply a cross-linguistic model of
   nativisation to BSL Corpus conversation and narrative data
   (http://bslcorpusproject.org) obtained from 150 signers in 6 UK regions.
   Mixed effects modelling is employed to determine the influence of social
   factors. Results show that the participants' home region is the most
   significant factor, with London and Birmingham signers significantly
   favouring use of fully nativised fingerspelled forms. Non-nativised
   sequences are significantly favoured in signers of increasing age in
   Glasgow and Belfast. Gender and parental language background are not
   found to be significant factors in nativisation. The findings also
   suggest a form of reduction specific to London and Birmingham.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings of a review of the literature on
   emergency admissions to hospital for older people in the UK, undertaken
   between May and June 2014 at the Health Services Management Centre,
   University of Birmingham. This review sought to explore: the rate of
   in/appropriate emergency admissions of older people in the UK; the way
   this is defined in the literature; solutions proposed to reduce the rate
   of inappropriate admissions; and the methodological issues which
   particular definitions of `inappropriateness' raise. The extent to which
   a patient perspective is included in these definitions of
   inappropriateness was also noted, given patient involvement is such a
   key policy priority in other areas of health policy. Despite
   long-standing policy debates, relatively little research has been
   published on formal rates of `inappropriate' emergency hospital
   admissions for older people in the UK NHS in recent years. What has been
   produced indicates varying rates of in/appropriateness, inconsistent
   ways of defining appropriateness and a lack of focus on the possible
   solutions to address the problem. Significantly, patient perspectives
   are lacking, and we would suggest that this is a key factor in fully
   understanding how to prevent avoidable admissions. With an ageing
   population, significant financial challenges and a potentially
   fragmented health and social care system, the issue of the
   appropriateness of emergency admission is a pressing one which requires
   further research, greater focus on the experiences of older people and
   their families, and more nuanced contextual and evidence-based
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To examine how misspellings of drug names could impede searches for
   published literature.
   DESIGN
   Database review.
   DATA SOURCE
   PubMed.
   REVIEW METHODS
   The study included 30 drug names that are commonly misspelt on
   prescription charts in hospitals in Birmingham, UK (test set), and 30
   control names randomly chosen from a hospital formulary (control set).
   The following definitions were used: standard names-the international
   non-proprietary names, variant names-deviations in spelling from
   standard names that are not themselves standard names in English
   language nomenclature, and hidden reference variants-variant spellings
   that identified publications in textword (tw) searches of PubMed or
   other databases, and which were not identified by textword searches for
   the standard names. Variant names were generated from standard names by
   applying letter substitutions, omissions, additions, transpositions,
   duplications, deduplications, and combinations of these. Searches were
   carried out in PubMed (30 June 2016) for ``standard name{[}tw]{''} and
   ``variant name{[}tw] NOT standard name{[}tw].{''}
   RESULTS
   The 30 standard names of drugs in the test set gave 325 979 hits in
   total, and 160 hidden reference variants gave 3872 hits (1.17\%). The
   standard names of the control set gave 470 064 hits, and 79 hidden
   reference variants gave 766 hits (0.16\%). Letter substitutions
   (particularly i to y and vice versa) and omissions together accounted
   for 2924 (74\%) of the variants. Amitriptyline (8530 hits) yielded 18
   hidden reference variants (179 (2.1\%) hits). Names ending in ``in,{''}
   ``ine,{''} or ``micin{''} were commonly misspelt. Failing to search for
   hidden reference variants of `` gentamicin,{''} ``amitriptyline,{''}
   ``mirtazapine,{''} and ``trazodone{''} would miss at least 19 systematic
   reviews. A hidden reference variant related to Christmas, ``No-el{''},
   was rare; variants of ``X-miss{''} were rarer.
   CONCLUSION
   When performing searches, researchers should include misspellings of
   drug names among their search terms.}},

Abstract = {{This article approaches debates about how the history of the post-1945
   English welfare state might be written. It argues that professionals'
   interventions on immigrant children can serve as a prism for
   understanding the crafting of the modern English welfare state. In this
   sense the article engages with the narrative concerning the resilience
   of a post-war British history that sees 1945 as a moment of profound
   rupture symbolised by the demise of Empire, the development of a
   universal welfare state, and the coming of mass immigration that brought
   with it social problems whose management presaged a distinctive British
   multiculturalism. Due to its influential impact on the development of
   immigrant education policies in England and because of its extensive
   education archive the article uses the Birmingham Local Education
   Authority (LEA) as an empirical and historical case. The significant
   British Nationality Act of 1948 and the Immigration Act of 1971 serve as
   demarcations of the period treated. The article concludes that the
   immigrant child and the child's background were consistently presented
   as educational problems and as the cause of both poor academic
   attainment and a more intangible unwillingness to assimilate. In this
   lens the crafting of the post-war English welfare state was a
   continuation of an imperial project shoring up imperial boundaries
   within as the former colonised appeared on English soil.}},

Abstract = {{This article throws light on the space and range of education
   professionals and their interventions against deviants understood as the

   English welfare state formation. Using Birmingham local education
   administration as an empirical and historical case, the influential
   Children Acts of 1948 and 1963 serve to demarcate the period treated.
   The theoretical framework is drawn from Bourdieu and Wacquant's concept
   of state, with the key concept being state-crafting'. The article
   contributes knowledge about the imaginaries, and the manufacturing and
   managing of the public good'understood as a referent for modern

Abstract = {{Prognostic models for the prediction of 90-day mortality after
   transplantation with pretransplant donor and recipient variables are
   needed to calculate transplant benefit. Transplants in adult recipients
   in Germany (Hannover, n=770; Kiel, n=234) and the United Kingdom
   (Birmingham, n=829) were used for prognostic model design and validation
   in separate training and validation cohorts. The survival benefit of
   transplantation was estimated by subtracting the observed posttransplant
   90-day mortality from the expected 90-day mortality without
   transplantation determined by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
   (MELD) score. A prognostic model called the liver allocation score
   (LivAS) was derived using a randomized sample from Hannover using
   pretransplant donor and recipient variables. This model could be
   validated in the German training and validation cohorts (area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve {[}AUROC]>0.70) but not in the
   English cohort (AUROC, 0.58). Although 90-day mortality rates after
   transplantation were 13.7\% in Hannover, 12.1\% in Kiel, and 8.3\% in
   Birmingham, the calculated 90-day survival benefits of transplantation
   were 6.8\% in Hannover, 7.8\% in Kiel, and 2.8\% in Birmingham.
   Deployment of the LivAS for limiting allocation to donor and recipient
   combinations with likely 90-day survival as indicated by pretransplant
   LivAS values below the cutoff value would have increased the survival
   benefit to 12.9\% in the German cohorts, whereas this would have
   decreased the benefit in England to 1.3\%. The English and German
   cohorts revealed significant differences in 21 of 28 pretransplant
   variables. In conclusion, the LivAS could be validated in Germany and
   may improve German allocation policies leading to greater survival
   benefits, whereas validation failed in England due to profound
   differences in the selection criteria for liver transplantation. This
   study suggests the need for national prognostic models. Even though the
   German centers had higher rates of 90-day mortality, estimated survival
   benefits were greater. Liver Transplantation 22 743-756 2016 AASLD.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To assess content validity and patient and provider
   prioritization of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
   System (PROMIS) depression, anxiety, fatigue, and alcohol use items in
   the context of clinical care for people living with HIV (PLWH), and to
   develop and assess new items as needed.
   Methods We conducted concept elicitation interviews (n = 161), item pool
   matching, prioritization focus groups (n = 227 participants), and
   cognitive interviews (n = 48) with English-speaking (similar to 75 \%)
   and Spanish-speaking (similar to 25 \%) PLWH from clinical sites in
   Seattle, San Diego, Birmingham, and Boston. For each domain we also
   conducted item review and prioritization with two HIV provider panels of
   3-8 members each.
   Results Among items most highly prioritized by PLWH and providers were
   those that included information regarding personal impacts of the
   concept being assessed, in addition to severity level. Items that
   addressed impact were considered most actionable for clinical care. We
   developed additional items addressing this. For depression we developed
   items related to suicide and other forms of self-harm, and for all
   domains we developed items addressing impacts PLWH and/or providers
   indicated were particularly relevant to clinical care. Across the 4
   domains, 16 new items were retained for further psychometric testing.
   Conclusion PLWH and providers had priorities for what they believed
   providers should know to provide optimal care for PLWH. Incorporation of
   these priorities into clinical assessments used in clinical care of PLWH
   may facilitate patient-centered care.}},

Abstract = {{Jane Austen's first publication was, the author believes, a letter
   signed Sophia Sentiment, which appeared in March 1789 in the ninth issue
   of the Oxford periodical The Loiterer, edited by her elder brother
   James. In the author's edition of Austen's juvenilia, published by
   Cambridge University Press in 2006, he considered, with due caution, the
   arguments for and against ascribing this letter to Austen. In the
   present essay, he takes a less diffident approach, outlining how Austen
   came to write a short but characteristically witty and irreverent piece
   that would be her first appearance in print. Sophia Sentiment's
   three-paragraph letter is a teasing reproach to ``the Author of the
   Loiterer{''} for having produced a journal that neglects women's
   interests. Austen creates a parody of the voracious but indiscriminate
   female reader. Sophia Sentiment is, she boasts, a ``great reader{''} who
   has got through ``some hundred volumes of Novels and Plays{''}, as well
   as ``all the entertaining papers of our most celebrated periodical
   writers{''}. The ninth issue of The Loiterer was the first to be sold by
   booksellers in Bath and Reading, as well as Oxford, London and
   Birmingham, giving Jane Austen, if she was indeed ``Sophia
   Sentiment{''}, her print debut in five English towns.}},

Title = {{A qualitative study exploring how Somali women exposed to female genital
   mutilation experience and perceive antenatal and intrapartum care in
   England}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore how Somali women exposed to female genital
   mutilation experience and perceive antenatal and intrapartum care in
   England. We explored women's perceptions of deinfibulation, caesarean
   section and vaginal delivery; their experiences of care during pregnancy
   and labour; and factors that affect ability to access these services, in
   order to make recommendations about future practice.
   Design: A descriptive, exploratory qualitative study using face-to-face
   semistructured interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed
   and data were analysed using a thematic approach. An interpreter was
   used when required (n=3).
   Setting: Participants recruited from 2 community centres in Birmingham,
   England.
   Participants: Convenience and snowball sample of 10 Somali women
   resident in Birmingham, who had accessed antenatal care services in
   England within the past 5 years.
   Results: 3 core themes were interpreted: (1) Experiences of female
   genital mutilation during life, pregnancy and labour: Female genital
   mutilation had a significant physical and psychological impact,
   influencing decisions to undergo deinfibulation or caesarean section.
   Women delayed deinfibulation until labour to avoid undergoing multiple
   operations if an episiotomy was anticipated. (2) Experience of care from
   midwives: Awareness of female genital mutilation from midwives led to
   open communication and stronger relationships with women, resulting in
   more positive experiences. (3) Adaptation to English life: Good language
   skills and social support networks enabled women to access these
   services, while unfavourable social factors (eg, inability to drive)
   impeded.
   Conclusions: Female genital mutilation impacts Somali women's
   experiences of antenatal and intrapartum care. This study suggests that
   midwives should routinely ask Somali women about female genital
   mutilation to encourage open communication and facilitate more positive
   experiences. As antenatal deinfibulation is unpopular, we should
   consider developing strategies to promote deinfibulation to non-pregnant
   women, to align with current guidelines. Women with unfavourable social
   factors may require additional support to improve access to English
   antenatal care services.}},

Abstract = {{Material histories have tended to obscure, rather than illuminate, the
   materials upon which they depend; because we are seldom ultimately
   interested in things themselves, histories of the material sort tend to
   turn to objects only as stepping stones to analyses of cultural
   contexts. This article is an experiment in a more symmetrical material
   history, seeking to take seriously the claims of a single historical
   object as it intersected with the life and autobiography of the
   historian who introduced it into discourse. The object is one of the two
   surviving examples of the Kineton Medal, a coin minted in haste in 1643
   to commemorate a high point of the English Civil War; the article's
   subject is John Evelyn (1620-1706), minor statesman, antiquary, and
   diarist, whose Numismata (1697) assembled a national history entirely
   out of fragments like this one. Evelyn's life and the trajectory of the
   medal were fated to cross in a number of ways; among others, the medal
   was introduced into history in the same gesture with which Evelyn
   established himself as a historian. Bringing subject and object into
   alignment has lessons to teach about the ways the fortunes of an object
   might wax and wane, even while life-writing collects and shapes its
   materials. By way of a coda, this article traces the career of this
   coin, which was believed to have been lost to fire, from its birth to
   its current home in Birmingham.}},

Abstract = {{Archbishop Rowan Williams's 2008 lecture, ``Civil and Religious Law in
   England: A Religious Perspective,{''} has become an historic reference
   point for discussions about relationships between Islam, religious law
   and English law. One of the Archbishop's heart-felt pleas was for
   ``deconstruction{''} of myths about both Islam and the Enlightenment.
   Continued stereotypes perpetuated by the ``Trojan Horse{''} debate over
   Birmingham schools and the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo event suggest
   the plea went unheard. This article aims to address factors that prevent
   objective assessment of the relationship between English law, religious
   laws, Islam and other faiths. It is hoped that this will help the
   deconstruction of myths by examining what the law says, the claims
   religious communities make and whether further change is needed. The
   relationship of religious laws, norms and courts to secular legal
   systems is a pertinent topic for Christian-Muslim dialogue to which it
   is hoped that this article might contribute. Amongst issues considered
   are the scope for more formal recognition or monitoring of religious
   laws that have an impact on the lives of some UK citizens, and arguments
   for recognition on the basis that a democracy should reflect all parties
   to its citizenship and protection of the most vulnerable. As calls for
   further recognition of religious laws arise, the deconstruction of myths
   can only smooth the way for their objective assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the motivation, scope, findings and reception of
   the survey of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham which
   the French journalist Leon Faucher published in Etudes sur l'Angleterre
   (1843-5). Sources include Faucher's letters, the original and revised
   text, the English translator's notes, and reviews in the British, French
   and German press. Faucher's fieldwork led him to question liberal
   orthodoxy and propose remedies to alleviate working-class distress.
   Exceptionally in eighteen-forties Britain, the continental
   socio-economic treatise was widely discussed and acclaimed. Elucidating
   Faucher's thought and setting it in context illuminates the contrast
   between him and other writers, particularly Friedrich Engels.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on contemporary debates in Germany on the extensive
   use of English in Germans' use of German. In particular, it focuses on
   the debate held at the University of Birmingham between Professor Jurgen
   Schiewe and Thomas Paulwitz on the question: ``The influence of English
   on German today: Grounds for concern?{''} The rise of a nationalist
   discourse on language since the mid-1990s is traced with particular
   reference to the Verein Deutsche Sprache and the quarterly publication
   Deutsche Sprachwelt. The purist position represented by Paulwitz, editor
   of Deutsche Sprachwelt, and opposed by Schiewe, Professor of German
   Philology at the University of Greifswald, is found to represent a
   discourse on national identity that fails to engage with modern
   linguistic science.}},

Abstract = {{Two campus novels written in the same decade, Don DeLillo's White Noise
   (1985) and David Lodge's Nice Work (1988), both feature protagonists who
   temporarily leave isolated academia to confront the larger world
   outside. In White Noise, Jack Gladney, an American professor of Hitler
   Studies at a fictional midwestern college, finds himself unprepared to
   deal with an ecological catastrophe as well as the threat of death. In
   Nice Work, Robyn Penrose, a temporary lecturer in English literature and
   women's studies at Lodge's fictionalized version of the University of
   Birmingham, confronts the inconsistencies in her thinking after meeting
   Vic Wilcox, the manager of an engineering firm. Both academics are
   satirized for their limited viewpoints and portrayed as benefitting from
   their experience through the realization that their academic careers
   have alienated them from the real world.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a linguistic ethnographic study of a Panjabi
   complementary school in Birmingham, UK. Researchers observed classes for
   one academic year, writing field notes, conducting interviews, and
   making digital audio recordings of linguistic interactions. Sets of
   beliefs about the production and deployment of certain linguistic signs
   were powerfully in play in the language learning classroom, as teachers
   and students negotiated what counts as the authenticity and legitimacy
   of the native speaker' teacher. Analysis of examples from empirical
   linguistic material focuses on the ways in which local practices
   constitute, and are related to, orders of indexicality and language
   ideologies. Analytical discussion offers an understanding of complex,
   situated, and nuanced negotiations of power in claiming and assigning
   authenticity and legitimacy in language learning contexts. The article
   considers the construction of the native speaker' heritage language
   teacher, and asks what counts as authentic and legitimate in teaching
   the community language, Panjabi, to a group of English-born young people
   who share Panjabi as a cultural and linguistic heritage.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1964 general election, the English town of Smethwick outside
   Birmingham became infamous for the unprecedented way in which issues of
   immigration, race and racism entered British national politics.
   Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths captured the Smethwick seat in
   Parliament from long-standing Labour MP Patrick Gordon Walker, aided by
   the slogan `If you want a nigger neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour'-a
   watershed episode soon overshadowed by the rise of Powellism in the late
   1960s. Debates between Griffiths, his supporters and his opponents in
   the early to mid-1960s about the local and national implications of
   `coloured' immigration (particularly of Indian Sikhs) from the
   Commonwealth and the legacy of empire drew upon a densely entangled set
   of global reference points that went beyond a `multi-racial' Britain
   being reshaped by its `multi-racial', postcolonial Commonwealth. Racist
   rhetoric, as well as an increasingly assertive anti-racist activism by
   the Indian Workers' Association and other groups, turned to analogies
   ranging from Nazi Germany to apartheid South Africa and racial
   segregation in the United States, as well as to protest techniques
   inspired by Gandhi in colonial India and African Americans in the civil
   rights movement. In Smethwick c. 1964, the global met the local,
   illuminating transnational flows of people and ideas about race and
   cultural diversity nonetheless contingent upon their time and place.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a study of Mosaic' - a piece of multilingual
   theatre-in-education designed to promote linguistically diverse
   practices in primary schools in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Focusing on
   the relatively uncharted territory of applied theatre as a means of
   promoting multilingualism, and challenging a culture of monolingual
   teaching and learning, the article examines how the piece enabled
   schools to begin to be re-imagined as places where creative,
   multilingual pedagogy and practice could take root. Two key theoretical
   concepts frame the study: (1) Postman's view of education as a
   counter-argument' to the prevailing biases of dominant cultural
   practices and (2) Bakhtin's concept of heteroglossia', which links
   multilingual practices to their social, political and historical power
   hierarchies. Based on data collected during the touring of Mosaic' -
   primarily audio recordings made of the interactions of six participating
   pupils - the article explores how the participatory approach adopted in
   Mosaic' sowed the seeds of counter-argument' not only to challenge
   dominant monolingual norms but also to enable children to negotiate and
   perform new social identities in relation to their multilingual
   resources. Implications for practice and future research are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: the belief that women and science, including mathematics and
   medicine, are incompatible has had a long and complex history and still
   often works to exclude women from and/or marginalise them in science.
   Purpose: this article will seek to explore gender and educational
   achievement through investigating how such gendered presumptions have
   persisted at various levels of science, despite perceptions of science
   itself changing over time and scientific studies expanding,
   differentiating and becoming professionalized. In particular, after a
   brief discussion of the historical debates on the provenance and lasting
   recurrence of gendered assumptions in science, it will try to discover
   how these prejudices affected the education of girls and women in
   England from c.1910 to c. 1939 and then, to widen the picture, make some
   comparison with the USA in the same period, although, necessarily in an
   article of this length, this analysis will be somewhat cursory. It will
   then bring the history up-to-date by examining the situation in England
   today. Sources of evidence: the article will proceed by using extensive
   local sources in case study research on Birmingham, by then the second
   largest English city. The comparisons with the situation in the USA in
   the same period and the examination of the present situation will be
   based largely on secondary sources. Main argument: factors of location,
   family background, supportive networks and greater educational,
   political and employment rights will be shown to have allowed some women
   to break through the barriers that hindered many from accessing or
   rising in science. Thus, it will be seen through the Birmingham example
   that there was a growing yet limited field of scientific practice for
   women, ordered by a gendered philosophy which routed them into specific
   areas. This picture was further permeated by class, wealth, identity,
   contacts, networks and location albeit this was modified by the
   scholarship system. Comparisons with the USA show that similar factors
   were present there, albeit in a different context. Twenty-first century
   sources indicate that on the one hand there is still gendered access and
   progress for females in science in England yet, on the other hand, there
   have been, and are at present, a number of initiatives seeking to
   overcome this. Conclusion: Even today, therefore, whatever sciences
   females do is affected by underlying gendered assumptions and structural
   power relationships which need to be understood.}},

Abstract = {{How prominent a role the workhouse played in the lives of older paupers
   in the nineteenth century is a matter of debate. This article addresses
   this issue, as well as the difficulty in determining who was classified
   as old and identifying them within Birmingham workhouse. It argues that
   Birmingham's institutionalisation rate of older paupers was more akin to
   London than an average provincial union. Birmingham was one of the few
   workhouses which provided dedicated facilities for those with
   disability, labelled `bedridden wards'. Examination of the inmates
   within these wards aids our understanding of the development of poor law
   institutions as providers of care for older people with chronic illness
   in the twentieth century.}},

Abstract = {{In an interview given during a lecture tour in Scandinavia organized by
   the universities of Copenhagen, Bergen, and Aarhus in October and
   November, 2012, Stanley Wells talks about his own career in Shakespeare
   studies and discusses past and present major changes and issues within
   the field, including his own Oxford Complete Works of 1986, co-edited
   with Gary Taylor et al., revision and collaboration theories, global
   Shakespeare, and new challenges for Shakespearean scholars. He shares
   thoughts on his own current and future research projects, which include
   a new monograph on Shakespearean actors through time, and he also
   comments on the relationship between academic scholars and theatre
   practitioners, and ways in which to understand the ever-shifting concept
   of a Shakespearean play in relation to performance, reading, and
   personal and critical responses. Following a long career of many
   publications and editions, Stanley Wells is now Professor Emeritus of
   the University of Birmingham, and Honorary President of the Shakespeare
   Birthplace Trust. Anne Sophie Haahr Refskou is a Doctoral Fellow in
   English and Dramaturgy at Aarhus University, Denmark. She works with
   Shakespearean acting and dramaturgy, focusing on the relationship
   between text and performance, particularly in relation to the actor's
   body and physical expressions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper centres around a discussion of the design and rebuild of a
   secondary school in Birmingham (England) as part of the Building Schools
   of the Future (BSF) Programme. The BSF Programme was influenced by a
   vision of future schooling in which learning environments are
   transformed by the integration of ICT into teaching and learning
   practices. The vision behind the BSF Programme suggests that schools of
   the future will embrace a learner-centred and skills-centred perspective
   and that the boundaries between home and school learning will become
   eroded. By contrast, the vision of the senior management team of this
   particular Birmingham shool emphasised the importance of subject-based
   learning (for example mathematics, science, English), and was moving
   away from a skills-based approach to the curriculum. The paper draws on
   Young and Muller's three scenarios for future schooling, in order to
   provide a framework for analysing the design of Park View School in
   Birmingham. The authors argue that the design of the new school is
   leading to new practices of teaching and learning that had not been
   anticipated by the senior management team. However, the BSF vision for
   how ICT would become embedded into the life of the school had not been
   realised at the time of writing this paper, and this, the authors argue,
   is because this vision is at odds with a focus on subject-based
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{In 1811 a group of businessmen based in Bedford in the English Midlands
   advanced the idea of connecting their then small town to the Grand
   Junction Canal, a highly profitable transport artery linking London to
   Birmingham and other manufacturing centres associated with the
   Industrial Revolution.
   However, the initiative faltered and by the middle of that century, much
   of the national canal network began a slow decline, supplanted by the
   new railways. However, a revival began in the 1960s and Britain's inland
   waterways assumed a new role in terms of leisure boating and other
   recreation. That decade also saw the birth of Milton Keynes with The
   Grand Junction (now Grand Union) Canal becoming an integral feature of
   this planned new city. These factors, and the prospect of opening up a
   large circuit combining lengths of canal and river for leisure cruising,
   provided the spur for a fresh look at the case for a link to Bedford.
   Two centuries after the initial vision, the planning of that waterway is
   now well advanced and the 26km route is safeguarded in planning terms.
   The task is now moving to that of defining the details, funding and
   implementation.
   These are straitened times in a country that has undergone big cuts in
   public expenditure, and many challenges lie ahead, both technical and
   economic. After charting the origins, progress and main characteristics
   of the project, the paper reviews the realism of what is planned. It
   explores the supposed economic benefits and other merits of the waterway
   and the intended section by section approach to building it. This is an
   exciting project that has captured the public's imagination but can it
   `stack up' and what wider lessons can be drawn?

Abstract = {{BackgroundTransepithelial elimination is a process by which dermal
   materials are expelled through an active epithelial-dermal connective
   tissue interaction. It has been described as a regular or sporadic
   occurrence in a variety of dermatologic conditions, including
   sarcoidosis.
   ObservationOur patient demonstrated a rare presentation of sarcoidosis
   involving the genital region, with histopathologic evidence of
   transepithelial elimination of granulomas. This prompted us to conduct
   the first case series documenting the frequency of transepithelial
   elimination in sarcoidosis.
   MethodsSlides of skin biopsies from patients (n=50) with cutaneous
   sarcoidosis from the University of Alabama at Birmingham were evaluated
   for transepithelial elimination. Transepithelial elimination was defined
   as epithelial channel formation with a sarcoidal-type granuloma
   completely surrounded by squamous epithelium on the section examined.
   ResultsTransepithelial elimination was found in 9 of 50 cases (18\%).
   ConclusionThis is the first report of transepithelial elimination in a
   lesion of sarcoidosis localized to the vulvar area, and one of only six
   reports in the English literature documenting cutaneous sarcoidosis with
   histopathologic evidence of transepithelial elimination. These reports
   are reviewed herein. Surprisingly, the results from this case series
   indicate that transepithelial elimination is more common in cutaneous
   sarcoidosis than one may surmise from the current literature.}},

Abstract = {{Commissioners are responsible for providing health care for defined

   A cross-sectional study using Hospital Episode Statistics to quantify

   patients not registered in primary care in English NHS hospitals.
   Unregistered patients were defined as those without a valid GP
   registration, prisoners, military personnel, asylum seekers/immigrants
   and the homeless.
   Unregistered patients accounted for 99 615 inpatient admissions and 370
   504 outpatient attendances in 2009/10, at a total cost of 242 m. Mental
   health accounted for 30 of all inpatient costs. The majority of
   unregistered patients were male and aged 2039 years. There were high
   levels of activity and cost in urban local authorities (LAs) (Birmingham
   and London) and LAs with links to military services (Salisbury,
   Richmondshire, Southampton). A high total inpatient cost was attributed
   to trauma, general medicine and mental health specialties. A high total
   outpatient cost was attributed to genitourinary medicine and trauma
   specialties.
   Health care use by unregistered populations is an important
   consideration for resource allocation and planning health care services

Title = {{Effect of telephone health coaching (Birmingham OwnHealth) on hospital
   use and associated costs: cohort study with matched controls}},
Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{347}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Objectives To test the effect of a telephone health coaching service
   (Birmingham OwnHealth) on hospital use and associated costs.
   Design Analysis of person level administrative data.
   Difference-in-difference analysis was done relative to matched controls.
   Setting Community based intervention operating in a large English city
   with industry.
   Participants 2698 patients recruited from local general practices before
   2009 with heart failure, coronary heart disease, diabetes, or chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease; and a history of inpatient or outpatient
   hospital use. These individuals were matched on a 1:1 basis to control
   patients from similar areas of England with respect to demographics,
   diagnoses of health conditions, previous hospital use, and a predictive
   risk score.
   Intervention Telephone health coaching involved a personalised care plan
   and a series of outbound calls usually scheduled monthly. Median length
   of time enrolled on the service was 25.5 months. Control participants
   received usual healthcare in their areas, which did not include
   telephone health coaching.
   Main outcome measures Number of emergency hospital admissions per head
   over 12 months after enrolment. Secondary metrics calculated over 12
   months were: hospital bed days, elective hospital admissions, outpatient
   attendances, and secondary care costs.
   Results In relation to diagnoses of health conditions and other baseline
   variables, matched controls and intervention patients were similar
   before the date of enrolment. After this point, emergency admissions
   increased more quickly among intervention participants than matched
   controls (difference 0.05 admissions per head, 95\% confidence interval
   0.00 to 0.09, P=0.046). Outpatient attendances also increased more
   quickly in the intervention group (difference 0.37 attendances per head,
   0.16 to 0.58, P<0.001), as did secondary care costs (difference 175
   pound per head, 22 pound to 328 pound, P=0.025). Checks showed that we
   were unlikely to have missed reductions in emergency admissions because
   of unobserved differences between intervention and matched control
   groups.
   Conclusions The Birmingham OwnHealth telephone health coaching
   intervention did not lead to the expected reductions in hospital
   admissions or secondary care costs over 12 months, and could have led to
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{An examination of recent gender scholarship demonstrates how a gendered
   lens has contributed to the debates on society, the state and education.
   Using local and international examples mostly from about 1880 to 1930,
   this paper will investigate how gendered perceptions coloured the
   provision of education, what we mean by the state and how much and what
   type of education it and other bodies have provided for females in
   different contexts. Following this, it will examine the growth of women
   in teaching, the challenges and limitations which beset them, the
   opportunities that were opened up to them and how far they and other
   women achieved authority and/or expertise in education in schools,
   colleges, educational administration and management, or as leaders and
   thinkers. This will illustrate the gendered thinking underlying much
   state education, but also show women as agents, building up networks and
   communities of women involved in education in multifarious ways,
   including transnational education. At the same time it can be seen that
   this has often belied imperialistic imperatives and ethnic
   condescension. Moving between local examples from Birmingham and Britain
   and international examples principally from English-speaking
   scholarship, the importance of gender history is argued because it
   reveals educational experiences and tiers of educational initiatives,
   practice and administration often neglected yet significant in
   education, while at the same time raising new questions. It does not
   just bring females into history, but understands history in a different
   and deeper way.}},

Abstract = {{The paralinguistic information in a speech signal includes clues to the
   geographical and social background of the speaker. This paper is
   concerned with automatic extraction of this information from a short
   segment of speech. A state-of-the-art language identification (LID)
   system is applied to the problems of regional accent recognition for
   British English, and ethnic group recognition within a particular
   accent. We compare the results with human performance and, for accent
   recognition, the `text dependent' ACCDIST accent recognition measure.
   For the 14 regional accents of British English in the ABI-1 corpus (good
   quality read speech), our LID system achieves a recognition accuracy of
   89.6\%, compared with 95.18\% for our best ACCDIST-hased system and
   58.24\% for human listeners. The `'Voices across Birmingham{''} corpus
   contains significant amounts of telephone conversational speech for the
   two largest ethnic groups in the city of Birmingham (UK), namely the
   `Asian' and `White' communities. Our LID system distinguishes between
   these two groups with an accuracy of 96.51\% compared with 90.24\% for
   human listeners. Although direct comparison is difficult, it seems that
   our LID system performs much better on the standard 12 class NIST 2003
   Language Recognition Evaluation task or the two class ethnic group
   recognition task than on the 14 class regional accent recognition task.
   We conclude that automatic accent recognition is a challenging task for
   speech technology, and speculate that the use of natural conversational
   speech may be advantageous for these types of paralinguistic task. (C)

Abstract = {{Hip resurfacing arthroplasty has gained popularity for treating young
   and active patients who have arthritis. There are two major data sources
   for assessing outcome and revision rate after total joint arthroplasty:
   sample-based clinical trials and national arthroplasty registers. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the Birmingham Hip
   Resurfacing (BHR) arthroplasty in terms of revision rate as reported in
   clinical studies and recorded by national arthroplasty registers.
   A comprehensive literature research was performed from English-language,
   peer-reviewed journals and annual reports from national joint
   arthroplasty registers worldwide. Only publications from MEDLINE-listed
   journals were included. The revision rate was used as the primary
   outcome parameter. In order to allow for direct comparison of different
   data sets, calculation was based on revisions per 100 observed component
   years. For statistical analysis, confidence intervals (CI) were
   calculated.
   A total of 18,708 implants, equivalent to 106,565 observed component
   years, were analysed in the follow-up studies. The register reports
   contained 9,806 primary cases corresponding to 44,294 observed component
   years. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in
   revisions per 100 observed component years between the development team
   (0.27; CI: 0.14-0.40) and register data (0.74; CI: 0.72-0.76).
   The BHR arthroplasty device shows good results in terms of revision rate
   in register data as well as in clinical studies. However, the excellent
   results reported by the development team are not reproducible by other
   surgeons. Based on the results of our study, we believe that
   comprehensive national arthroplasty registers are the most suitable tool
   for assessing hip arthroplasty revision rate.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The validity and functional predictive values of the apraxia
   tests in the Birmingham Cognitive Screen (BCoS) were evaluated. BCoS was
   developed to identify patients with different forms of praxic deficit
   using procedures designed to be inclusive for patients with aphasia
   and/or spatial neglect.
   Method Observational studies were conducted from a university
   neuropsychological assessment centre and from acute and rehabilitation
   stroke care hospitals throughout an English region. Volunteers from
   referred patients with chronic acquired brain injuries, a consecutive
   hospital sample of patients within 3 months of stroke (n=635) and a
   population based healthy control sample (n=100) were recruited. The main
   outcome measures used were the Barthel Index, the Nottingham Extended
   Activities of Daily Living Scale as well as recovery from apraxia.
   Results There were high inter-rater reliabilities and correlations
   between the BCoS apraxia tasks and counterpart tests from the
   literature. The vast majority (88.3\%) of the stroke survivors were able
   to complete the screen. Pantomime and gesture recognition tasks were
   more sensitive in differentiating between individuals with left
   hemisphere damage and right hemisphere damage whereas the Multistep
   Object Use test and the imitation task had higher functional correlates
   over and above effects of hemiplegia. Together, the initial scores of
   the four tasks enabled predictions with 75\% accuracy, the recovery of
   apraxia and independence level at 9 months.
   Conclusions As a model based assessment, BCoS offers a quick and valid
   way to detect apraxia and predict functional recovery. It enables early
   and informative assessment of most stroke patients for rehabilitation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Whispered speech is a relatively common form of communications, used
   primarily to selectively exclude or include potential listeners from
   hearing a spoken message. Despite the everyday nature of whispering, and
   its undoubted usefulness in vocal communications, whispers have received
   relatively little research effort to date, apart from some studies
   analyzing the main whispered vowels and some quite general estimations
   of whispered speech characteristics. In particular, a classic vowel
   space determination has been lacking for whispers. For voiced speech,
   this type of information has played an important role in the development
   and testing of recognition and processing theories over the past few
   decades and can be expected to be equally useful for whisper-mode
   communications and recognition systems.
   This article aims to redress the shortfall by presenting a vowel formant
   space for whispered speech and comparing the results with corresponding
   phonated samples. In addition, because the study was conducted using
   speakers from Birmingham, the analysis extends to discuss the effect of
   the common British West Midlands accent in comparison with Standard
   English (Received Pronunciation). Thus, the article presents the
   analysis of formant data showing differences between normal and
   whispered speech while also considering an accentual effect on whispered

   What is the problem with Richard Bean's recent work?}},

Abstract = {{This article highlights the way in which the current critical turn
   towards cosmopolitanism may signal a return to universalism, in which
   the cultural values of the most powerful are assumed to be globally
   applicable norms. Such a tendency is located in two of Richard Bean's
   recent works, England People Very Nice and The Big Fellah, the first of
   which attracted media attention when premiered in 2009 by becoming the
   first play at the Royal National Theatre to create an onstage protest.
   This article seeks to understand what motivated the demonstration,
   revealing how England People Very Nice ignores the complex dynamics of
   colonialism and decolonization in favour of a narrative that flattens
   and homogenizes the migrant experience. Bean may wish to engage with the
   hopes and difficulties of an assortment of different communities, but
   his play revolves around a discomforting binarism, measuring a foreign
   `them' against an English `us'. Although Bean's next play, The Big
   Fellah, is less well known, it is revealed to share similar flaws. The
   Big Fellah seeks to describe a gang of IRA-supporters in New York, but
   is largely devoid of explanatory context and is constructed in a form
   critiqued by Raymond Williams as being inadequate to explain historical
   process. Once again, an ethnic group is paraded in order that its
   beliefs and actions can be analysed, yet the audience is denied the
   contextualizing tools with which to conduct that analysis. The article
   concludes by finding an example of a performance that contrasts with
   Bean's work, highlighting what Puina Werbner defines as `working-class
   cosmopolitanism' in an annual community event organized by the Irish in
   inner-city Birmingham.}},

   in the decades around the turn of the twentieth century, particularly in

   of reading and analysing log books, and considers their value as a
   historical source. It considers how far headteachers particularly those
   working in schools in poor urban areas - were able to intervene in
   practice in the lives of their pupils, and the implications of this
   analysis for thinking about the work of teachers in the present day.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a detailed reconstruction of the processes leading
   to the formation of the widely influential Birmingham Agreed Syllabus of
   Religious Instruction (1975). This is contextualised within one of the
   most significant periods in the history of race relations in the United
   Kingdom. The authors discuss how this syllabus, and other landmark
   reforms in religious education (RE) in English schools from the late
   1960s, responded to ethnic diversity by promoting supposedly culturally
   pluralist, multi-faith approaches to RE, which were subsequently
   perceived as eroding the Christian foundations of British/English
   national identity. They argue that the vilification of these curriculum
   reforms by culturally conservative critics was in fact based on an
   erroneous assessment of the extent to which these renounced the
   Christian hegemony of RE. They also critique the assumption that the
   religious clauses of the 1988 Education Reform Act represented a simple
   transition from culturally pluralist to assimilationist policies for the
   subject.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) frequently starts
   with an affection of the nasal and paranasal mucosa. Localised GPA of
   the nasal mucosa or persistent disease activity ({''}grumbling
   disease{''}) is often encountered even under immunosuppressive therapy.
   Necessity for reconstructive surgery is common and careful scheduling to
   prevent failure and minimise revision rates is crucial. Therefore,
   reliable estimation of GPA activity in the upper airways using a score
   is mandatory for diagnosis, follow-up and scheduling reconstructive
   surgery.
   Patients and methods. Fifty endoscopic, endonasal images of 45 patients
   with GPA were used. Twelve (4 German, 8 Mexican) experienced (n=7) and
   inexperienced (n=5) physicians assessed GPA-activity at two times
   (T1/T2) in dichotomy and in a grading approach (none, mild, moderate and
   high activity) using the novel ENT Activity Score (ENTAS). All documents
   were written in English.
   Results. Estimation of activity in dichotomy (none vs.
   mild/moderate/high): Cohen's Kappa (kappa) for intra-rater reliability
   T1/T2 in inexperienced and experienced physicians was kappa=0.58
   (agreement 85\%) and kappa=0.72 (agreement 91\%). The interrater
   reliability (Fleiss's kappa) T1/T2 for inexperienced and experienced
   physicians was kappa=0.62/kappa=0.59 and kappa=0.50/kappa=0.58
   respectively. Estimation of activity in grading approach (none, mild,
   moderate, high): for inexperienced physicians the intra-rater
   reliability T1/T2 was kappa=0.67 (agreement 56\%) and the interrater
   reliability at T1/T2 was kappa=0.29 (intraclass correlation coefficient,
   ICC=0.69) and kappa=0.27 (ICC=0.59). For experienced physicians the
   intra-rater reliability T1/T2 was kappa=0.80 (agreement 67\%) and the
   inter-rater reliability at T1 and T2 was kappa=0.41 (ICC=0.77) and
   kappa=0.39 (ICC=0.75) respectively.
   Conclusion. Intra-rater reliability is high in decision in dichotomy and
   even in grading activity. There is no difference for experienced or
   inexperienced physicians. Inter-rater reliability is high in dichotomy,
   but low for activity grading. Thus, the ENTAS provides a reliable
   instrument for assessing, documenting and following GPA-related disease
   activity in the upper respiratory tract. The relationship of activity
   and following damage needs to be investigated in further studies.}},

Abstract = {{James Chandler, Edgeworth and the Lunar Enlightenment
   Maria Edgeworth was arguably the most important novelist writing in
   English during the early Regency period. Her narrative art was informed
   by her influential educational theories, and in its turn it decisively
   shaped the very different oeuvres of Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott,
   whose successes in fiction would somewhat eclipse hers. If Edgeworth's
   novels came to seem puzzling in their design, the reason may lie in the
   distinctive disciplinary context from which they emerged. For Edgeworth
   followed her highly accomplished and polymath father in engaging with
   the projects of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, which included diverse
   intellectuals such as James Watt, Erasmus Darwin, and Joseph Priestley.
   The Lunar commitment to improvement through experiment, I argue, not
   only set the terms for the agricultural, mechanical, and educational
   efforts carried out by Richard Edgeworth and his daughter on their Irish
   estate, it also helps to make sense of the novels and tales Maria wrote
   there, especially her remarkable analysis of contemporary fashionable
   life in Belinda (1801).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Smoking prevalence is high among Pakistani and Bangladeshi
   men in the UK, but there are few tailored smoking cessation programmes
   for Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The aim of this study was to
   pilot a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness
   of Pakistani and Bangladeshi smoking cessation outreach workers with
   standard care to improve access to and the success of English smoking
   cessation services.
   Methods: A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in
   Birmingham, UK. Geographical lower layer super output areas were used to
   identify natural communities where more than 10\% of the population were
   of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. 16 agglomerations of super output
   areas were randomised to normal care controls vs. outreach intervention.
   The number of people setting quit dates using NHS services, validated
   abstinence from smoking at four weeks, and stated abstinence at three
   and six months were assessed. The impact of the intervention on choice
   and adherence to treatments, attendance at clinic appointments and
   patient satisfaction were also assessed.
   Results: We were able to randomise geographical areas and deliver the
   outreach worker-based services. More Pakistani and Bangladeshi men made
   quit attempts with NHS services in intervention areas compared with
   control areas, rate ratio (RR) 1.32 (95\%CI: 1.03-1.69). There was a
   small increase in the number of 4-week abstinent smokers in intervention
   areas (RR 1.30, 95\%CI: 0.82-2.06). The proportion of service users
   attending weekly appointments was lower in intervention areas than
   control areas. No difference was found between intervention and control
   areas in choice and adherence to treatments or patient satisfaction with
   the service. The total cost of the intervention was 124,000; pound an
   estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of 8,500
   pound.
   Conclusions: The intervention proved feasible and acceptable. Outreach
   workers expanded reach of smoking cessation services in diverse
   locations of relevance to Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The
   outreach worker model has the potential to increase community cessation
   rates and could prove cost-effective, but needs evaluating definitively
   in a larger, appropriately powered, randomised controlled trial. These
   future trials of outreach interventions need to be of sufficient
   duration to allow embedding of new models of service delivery.}},

   qualitative study of beliefs about medicines in Rheumatoid arthritis and

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate factors that influence beliefs about medicines
   in patients of South Asian origin with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods: Qualitative methodology was used to explore the health beliefs
   of South Asian patients and in particular the factors that influenced
   their beliefs about medicines and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
   (DMARDs). Thirty two patients with RA and SLE took part in focus group
   discussions. Patients who chose to participate in focus groups conducted
   in English were compared with those who chose to participate groups
   conducted in Punjabi or Urdu.
   Results: Three main themes emerged to explain patients beliefs about
   medicines: (1) Beliefs about the necessity of DMARDs; (2) Concerns about
   DMARDs and other prescribed medicines including: (a) long-term
   side-effects; (b) the apparent lack of efficacy of some therapies; (c)
   concerns about changing from one drug to another and the large numbers
   of different medicines being taken; (3) Contextual factors which
   informed the patient's view on the necessity for particular medicines
   and concerns about them including: (a) beliefs about the causes of
   disease and the influence of religious beliefs on this; (b) barriers to
   communication with health care professionals about the medications being
   prescribed in clinic. In addition, our data revealed that these beliefs
   about DMARDs had important consequences for patient behaviour, including
   the use of traditional dietary and other non-pharmacological approaches.
   There were differences in views expressed between those who chose to
   speak in English and those who did not.
   Conclusion: This study has identified themes that explain previous
   findings of negative beliefs about medicines in patients of South Asian
   origin. Beliefs about the causes of disease had an important impact on
   the way some patients viewed medicines for RA and SLE. This will have
   implications for educational programmes designed to promote patient
   involvement in disease management. Lupus (2011) 20, 837-844.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of social groups within a given accent is a challenging
   refinement of language identification (LID) and accent/dialect
   recognition. The 2001 census of England and Wales identifies two main
   ethnic groups in the city of Birmingham, which it refers to as Asian and
   white. In this paper LID techniques are applied to the problem of
   identifying individuals from these two groups who were born in
   Birmingham and hence speak British English with a Birmingham accent. An
   Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.57\% is obtained using a LID system which
   fuses the outputs of several acoustic and phonotactic systems. This
   performance is much better than expected and compares to an EER of
   8.72\% achieved by human listeners. The implications of this result for
   automatic speech recognition are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present article offers an historical perspective on the 1975, 1995
   and 2007 Birmingham Agreed Syllabuses for Religious Education. It draws
   upon historical evidence uncovered as part of `The hidden history of
   curriculum change in religious education in English schools, 1969-1979'
   project, and curriculum history theories, especially David Labaree's
   observations about the distance between the `rhetorical' and `received'
   curricula. We argue that, contrary to the existing historiography,
   curriculum change in religious education (RE) has been evolutionary not
   revolutionary. Multiple reasons are posited to explain this, not least
   among which is the capacity and agency of teachers. Furthermore, we
   argue that ongoing debates about the nature and purpose of RE, as
   exemplified in the Birmingham context, reflect the multiple expectations
   that religious educators and other stakeholders had, and continue to
   have, of the curriculum subject. These debates contribute to the inertia
   evident in the implementation of RE curriculum reforms. A consciousness
   of the history of RE enables curriculum contestations to be
   contextualised and understood, and, thereby, provides important insights
   which can be applied to ongoing and future debates and developments.}},

   curriculum documents, interviews were also conducted with some English
   teachers and young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-gender
   (LGBT)-identified people who attended, or had recently left, secondary
   school in Birmingham, U. K. Key findings indicate that issues around
   sexual diversity are noticeably absent from the curriculum, while other
   forms of diversity are more visible. This means that teachers are not
   explicitly encouraged to explore sexual diversity in their teaching, and
   the effects of this on young LGBT-identified people are overwhelmingly
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{The great English choral tradition as we know it today was born along
   with the Industrial Revolution with the development of choral societies
   like the oldest, the Halifax Choral Society in 1817, while the
   Birmingham Choral Society, founded in 1843, was to provide a chorus for
   the town's Triennial Music Festival. Those societies were fostered so as
   to tame, civilise and educate the potentially unruly new unskilled
   labour force who manned ``the dark Satanic mills{''} of the expanding
   northern industrial cities and to lead them away from drink or the
   profanities of the nascent music-halls. Their favourite repertoire was
   the English oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn, a genre which
   flourished all century long in the wake of the great religious awakening
   of the late eighteenth century and provided English and foreign
   composers with work in an opera-shy kingdom. Various social reformers,
   like John Curwen of Tonic Sol-Fa fame, developed methods to teach the
   untrained choristers how to read music, thus permitting their exposure
   to high-brow culture, to which the policy of the music publisher Novello
   greatly contributed. Paradoxically, the Renaissance of English music in
   the late 19th century benefited from the craze for choral singing but
   also somehow triggered its demise when native composers, who had
   assimilated the lessons of their foreign competitors and raised their
   standards of composition, required more from their amateur choristers,
   gradually forced to give up in favour of professionals, increasing the
   gap between popular and high brow culture.}},

Abstract = {{This essay explores the extent to which some of the political upheavals
   of twentieth-century Ireland, and their related theatrical
   manifestations, might reveal a series of affinities with the organised
   political radicalism of nineteenth-century England. Specifically, the
   playhouse dramas written by the executed leader of the Easter Rising of
   1916, Padraic Pearse (also known as Padraig or Patrick) point back to
   the earlier Liberal reform meetings that took place in the English
   midlands. The key connecting figure is the revolutionary leader's
   father, James Pearse, who spent his life between Birmingham and Dublin,
   but who has tended to be overlooked by historians in the years since
   1916.
   This paper will explore the way that throughout the twentieth-century a
   focus on Padraic Pearse's mother has tended to obscure the influence of
   James Pearse. Yet I suggest that James-influenced by Liberal thinkers
   such as the MP John Bright-helped to link one kind of waning English
   radicalism with the developing nationalism of twentieth-century Ireland.
   It is in this context that my paper explores the political implications
   of Patrick Pearse's theatrical writings, The King, The Master and The
   Singer, tracing connections between these plays and the Birmingham
   radicalism of James Pearse, with a particular focus on James's
   nonconformist reformism and day-to-day involvement with the Catholic
   pomp of the Hardman church-furnishing company.}},

   are working together in a TEMPUS PROJECT called Student EXchanges and
   credit Transfer Assisted by New information Technology (SEXTANT) TEMPUS
   UM\_JEP\_27184-2006 (RU) to promote better student exchanges and related
   European Credit Transfers supported by web-enabled information systems.
   The objectives of this SEXTANT project are:
   Introduction of new IT tools to support students exchanges and
   networking at selected Russian Higher Education (HE) institutions
   Implementation of ECTS for selected study areas
   Creation of Quality Assurance (QA) mechanisms to facilitate student
   exchanges and improve student management services at partner
   institutions
   The following outcomes are identified:
   A (developed) MSPU and DSPU policy on implementation of ECTS in
   accordance with the European guide book
   e-database on student mobility and e-Student Mobility Support System
   (e-SMOSS)
   MSPU and DSPU administrative staff trained in management of student
   mobility
   Best practices for adaptation of existing international courses and
   study records towards ECTS formats and structures
   Upgrade of English language skills as foreign language for Russian
   academic and administrative staff
   e-ECTS catalogue of courses taught in English
   During the project extra creativity, energy and confidence was needed to
   overcome problems like political instability in the Dagestan region,
   cultural differences between Russian and other (Western) European
   universities, required administrative support, differences in
   organization and objectives.
   Finally the implementation of the web-based Student Exchange System and
   ECTS catalogue was tested by exchanges of students in both directions
   and the development of virtual mobility by use of electronic course
   materials. Further educational, research and administrative staff was
   exchanged.
   Sustainability of this initiative is assured by the set-up of an
   interuniversity exchange supporting unit. The last three months of this
   2 year project are devoted to dissemination of the results and a
   specific congress in MSPU.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve full native-like competence in a second language,
   speakers must also acquire sociolinguistic awareness in that language.
   This paper reports the results of a study investigating the acquisition
   of sociolinguistic awareness among immigrant Polish adolescents learning
   English in the UK. This paper asks whether Polish-born adolescents
   living in the UK can identify different varieties of British English as
   well as their native-speaker peer group can and whether they share
   similar evaluations of these varieties of English as their
   native-speaker peer group. The results of a variety recognition survey
   suggest that Polish-born adolescents now living in the UK are not yet
   able to identify different varieties of English. However, the vast
   majority of evaluations carried out by Polish- and UK-born adolescents
   were not statistically different. Furthermore, we see clear evidence of
   the acquisition of the muted evaluations typically associated with the
   two varieties of English that are most positively and negatively
   evaluated among the UK-born adolescents: received pronunciation and
   Birmingham English. We suggest that our study provides a snapshot of the
   initial stages of the acquisition of attitudes towards variation in a
   second language.}},

Abstract = {{Chapain C. and Comunian R. Enabling and inhibiting the creative economy:
   the role of the local and regional dimensions in England, Regional
   Studies. Integrating findings from two separate research projects in
   Birmingham and Newcastle-Gateshead in England, this paper explores
   factors that enable or inhibit the development of creative and cultural
   industries in English regions outside London. The findings question
   current creative and cultural industries policies and their
   understanding of the local and regional dimensions as being limited to
   the idea of geographical clusters. Instead, the paper calls for a wider
   approach that also takes into account the importance of the regional
   infrastructure and the `knowledge pool' necessary to the development of
   creative and cultural industries, but also personal and operational
   connections of the creative and cultural industries within and outside
   their region.}},

Abstract = {{Sunley P., Pinch S. and Macmillen J. Growing design? Challenges and
   constraints facing design consultancies in three English city-regions,
   Regional Studies. There is some debate as to whether creative industries
   can thrive in second-tier industrial city-regions, as well as in leading
   global cities. This paper uses the results of firm interviews with
   design consultancies to examine their experiences in three industrial
   cities in the United Kingdom: Manchester; Newcastle, and Birmingham. It
   highlights the major constraints on growth in each city and it
   emphasizes the quantity and quality of demand, and the availability of
   skilled labour. It considers the effects of design and cultural policy
   initiatives and finds that most measures are perceived to have had only
   ambiguous and minor supportive impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pseudoaneurysm (PA) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a
   rare complication with incidence less than 1\%. There is a potential for
   rupture, embolization, thrombosis or compression of cranial nerves.
   Objective: We reviewed our experience and compare it to the literature
   to raise awareness of this rare though serious condition. It is crucial
   to treat these patients earl), to avoid the hazardous consequences.
   Methods: A review of the case records of patients who had CEA at
   University Hospital Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust from
   1990-2007, was undertaken. Information of patients including their
   aetiology, presenting features, treatment and results W IS collected.
   The English-language literature was searched using PubMed database for
   post CEA pseudoaneurysm. Results: Five patients developed post CEA PA.
   This represents 0.4\% of the 1200 CEA performed at Our hospital in the
   last 18 years. The timing of their presentation varied from three days
   to eight months after the original operation. All had patch
   reconstruction after CEA. Patches were intact at exploration of the PAS.
   There was one death and one stroke. The literature revealed 154 carotid
   PAs after CEA and two cases following carotid stenting 52 of these cases
   had infected PA. Patients with synthetic patches have the least
   incidence of infection. More than 80\% had open surgery and 9\% had
   endovascular repair. Conclusion: Post CEA Surveillance is necessary to
   detect patients with PA early. Factors that favour infection must be
   avoided. Endovascular repair of carotid PA should be encouraged in
   specialised centres.}},

Abstract = {{The collection of John Henry Newman's letters is now complete. It has
   taken the Birmingham Oratory almost fifty years and seven editors to
   complete a task that Newman himself had started as early as 1825 and
   that his friends and/or biographers had attempted at different times.
   This collection-{''}the finest collection (of letters) in the English
   language{''}-comprises about 20,000 letters in 32 volumes, making it
   necessary for the average reader to refer to selections; two have been
   published in the last fifty years and the more recent one, translated
   under the aegis of the Association Francaise des Amis de Newman, was
   published for the centenary of Newman's death that the French public may
   get to know the person of the cardinal in the context of the time.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To examine whether the relationship between vision impairment and
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in nursing-home residents is
   impacted by coexisting cognitive impairment.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study involved a total of 382
   English-speaking older adults (>55 years of age) with >= 13 on the Mini
   Mental State Exam (MMSE) from seventeen nursing homes in Birmingham,
   Alabama. Assessments were taken of visual acuity (Lighthouse Near Visual
   Acuity Test), cognition (MMSE) and health-related quality of life
   (Nursing Home Vision-Targeted Health-Related Quality of Life
   Questionnaire, VF-14, and the SF-36).
   Results: A greater portion of participants had both vision and cognitive
   impairments (38.5\%) as compared with those with neither impairment
   (21.5\%), vision impairment alone (13.4\%), and cognitive impairment
   alone (26.7\%). Cognitive impairment did not modify the impact of vision
   impairment on HRQoL. The reduction in HRQoL associated with vision
   impairment was similar for those with and without cognitive impairment.
   Conclusion: The deleterious impact of vision impairment on HRQoL in
   nursing-home residents was not exacerbated by the co-occurrence of
   cognitive impairment. Ageing-related visual impairment in nursing-home
   residents is often reversible through treatment leading to improved
   HRQoL, and thus it is clinically important to know that cognitive
   impairment is unlikely to interfere with this benefit.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effect of vision-enhancing interventions (cataract

   Longitudinal cohort study.
   Seventeen nursing homes in Birmingham, Alabama.
   A total of 187 English-speaking adults aged 55 and older.
   Participants took part in one of two vision-enhancing interventions:
   cataract surgery or refractive error correction. Each group was compared
   against a control group (persons eligible for but who declined cataract
   surgery or who received delayed correction of refractive error).
   Physical function (ability to perform activities of daily living and
   mobility) was assessed using a series of self-report and certified
   nursing assistant ratings at baseline and at 2 months for the refractive
   error correction group and at 4 months for the cataract surgery group.
   The Mini Mental State Examination was also administered.
   No significant differences existed within or between groups from
   baseline to follow-up on any of the measures of physical function.
   Mental status scores significantly declined from baseline to follow-up
   for the immediate (P=.05) and delayed (P <.02) refractive error
   correction groups and for the cataract surgery control group (P=.05).
   Vision-enhancing interventions did not lead to short-term improvements
   in physical functioning or cognitive status in this sample of elderly
   nursing home residents.}},

Abstract = {{Arthur Schnitzler's cycle of sexual permutations in fin de siecle Vienna
   has always been prone to problems of translation - not least of its
   title, properly in German Reigen, but often miscalled La Ronde, after
   Max Ophuls's film version of 1950. But its problems for translators also
   derive from the cultural specificity of its time and place, and in this
   article Heidi Zojer first examines how its numerous English translators
   have tried to overcome the difficulties the play presents, illustrating
   from a cross-section of versions examples of its resistance to easy
   translation, whether `faithful' or colloquial. She concludes that freer
   adaptations such as David Hare's The Blue Room (1998) have in fact been
   truer to the spirit of Schnitzler's play - while perhaps truest of all
   has been Carlo Gebler's complete rewriting, in Ten Rounds (1999), which
   `translated' the play to contemporary Belfast during the years of the
   peace process. Heidi Zojer was awarded her D. Phil. from the University
   of Innsbruck, Austria, in 1999. From 2000 to 2002 she was Lecturer at
   the University of Birmingham, and since then has been teaching at
   University College Dublin.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a qualitative analysis of
   semi-structured interviews with 79 members of the Birmingham Untreated
   Heavy Drinkers Cohort. The cohort was recruited in 1997 when all
   participants were drinking 50 or more standard units of alcohol (men) or
   35 or more units (women) most weeks. Present interviews were carried out
   as part of the fourth wave of interviews, held in 2003. The topic was
   the participants' places of drinking in the community and the functions
   those places served. The present analysis focused on the relationship
   between pubs and community. The strongest theme to emerge was that the
   pub provided for many participants a real sense of community in itself.
   It did so by enabling participants to meet with like-minded others, in a
   setting distinct from home or work, where conversing and confiding Could
   take place in a relaxed atmosphere, with a range of other activities and
   forms of social support available to many. At the same time,
   participants were discriminating about which pubs they used, and when,
   and with whom they chose to interact. There was less consensus about
   whether the pub served a wider function by contributing to a positive
   sense of community in the local neighbourhood. It is suggested that
   English pubs, at least in a large conurbation such as the West Midlands,
   are very varied, sometimes continuing to serve as `the local' for a
   community, sometimes being part of a variety of drinking places which
   between them provide people with it diversity of social niches to meet
   their increasingly diverse choices and preferences, and sometimes
   reflecting and even contributing to local community disorganisation.

Title = {{NEO-GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE OEUVRE OF HERMAN BOLLE}},
Journal = {{PROSTOR}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{244-267}},
Abstract = {{Herman Bolle (Cologne, 1845 - Zagreb, 1926) was an architect whose name
   was in the history of Croatian historicist architecture indelibly tied
   to Neo-Gothic. His interest for the Gothic style was doubtlessly greatly
   influenced by the fact that the first 27 years of his life were spent in
   Cologne, the city which in that period witnessed the construction of the
   biggest Neo-Gothic building in Europe - Cologne Cathedral - which
   entered the 19(th) century with completed body of the building, chancel,
   area, and the partly built south tower on the main facade. After working
   at his father's studio as a carver and mason and between 1866 and 1872
   in the studio of Heinrich Wiethase, a Neo-Gothic architect and longterm
   associate of Friedrich von Schmidt from his days of life and work in
   Cologne, Bolle continued to develop his knowledge and interest in the
   Neo-Gothic style.
   During the days of his employment at Schmidt's studio (1872-79) in
   Vienna Bolle was taking part in a number of Schmidt's Neo-Gothic
   buildings. He was assisting on all three big Neo-Gothic churches Schmidt
   was building. They included the churches in the Viennese quarters of
   Weissgarbern, Brigittenau and Funfhaus, renovation of the National
   Bank's building, built in the German Renaissance style and Schmidt's
   projects in Croatia, starting from 1876 (cathedrals in Dakovo and
   Zagreb, Academy's building, St Mark's Church in Zagreb).
   Both his own wish for independence and the encouragement by the first
   Croatian educated art historian Iso Krsnjavi and Dakovo Bishop Josip
   Juraj Strossmayer, enticed Bolle to move to Zagreb in 1879, where he was
   going to live and work until his death in 1926. Before his arrival
   Neo-Gothic was hardly penetrating into Croatian architecture. It was
   only owing to the efforts of Iso Krsnjavi in the end of the 1870s and
   beginning of the 1880s that this style suddenly spread. As early as
   1879, Bolle made his first Neo-Gothic building in Zagreb - the monastery
   of St Mary Magdalen in Josipovac, and started working on the restoration
   of Zagreb Cathedral, first according to the designs of Friedrich von
   Schmidt, and later his own designs.
   The earthquake that hit Zagreb in 1880 ensured Bolle a number of
   projects which were additionally secured by Iso Krsnjavi's constant
   lobbying at the institutions of the Zagreb Archdiocese. Lobbying for
   Bolle was also lobbying for the style which Krsnjavi considered most
   suited for the restoration of buildings in Kaptol, a part of Zagreb
   which was largely in the hands of various institutions of the Catholic
   Church. In other words, Krsnjavi wanted the restoration of old and
   construction of new buildings in Kaptol to be done in the Neo-Gothic
   style in order for them to be in harmony with Zagreb Cathedral after the
   completion of its restoration. Bolle got an opportunity to build two
   deans' manor houses in Kaptol and one prebendary manor house in Nova Ves
   Street (the street which runs from Kaptol to the north). He made them in
   the Neo-Gothic and Neo-Romanesque style with brick facades which Zagreb
   people did not like much since they were more used to plaster facades.
   At the same time Bolle was entrusted with the restoration of the Zagreb
   seminary and its chapel (1881-83) which are connected on the north side
   to the cathedral and bishop's palace. He also worked on the buildings of
   the Evangelical church and municipality in Lower Town in Zagreb
   (1881-84). The architectural design of the facade of the Evangelical
   church, as well as the interior of the seminary chapel (covered with a
   wooden roof supported by built Gothic arches) clearly show the influence
   of St Brigitte's Church in Brigittenau by Friedrich von Schmidt, which
   was, in turn, built probably under the influence of St Chad's Cathedral
   in Birmingham (1839-41) by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin.
   During the 1880s Bolle designed several big sepulchral monuments, namely
   the chapel-mausoleum of the Pejacevic family in Nasice (1880-81),
   mausoleum of the Jelacic family in Zapresic (1884) and the tombstone for
   Ladislav Vulkelic in Sveti Kriz Zacretje (1887). The quality of Bolle's
   accomplishments from the beginning of the 1880s, just as his affiliation
   to the regime of Viceroy Khuen-Hedervary (in power from 1883-1903)
   ensured his quick affirmation in Croatia, as well as numerous projects.
   Bolle's work in the second half of the 1880s and in the beginning of
   1890s was marked by the construction of several sacral buildings whose
   design show strong influence of St Brigitte's Church in Vienna. They
   include the parish churches in Granesina (1886-87), Franjin Dol
   (1887-88), Erdevik (1889-90), and the chapel of St Mathew in Gornja
   Stubica (restored in 1896). In 1885 Bolle started the restoration of the
   Franciscan church in Kaptol, Zagreb. Between 1885 and 1888 he built a
   new tower, restored the chancel and added a new chapel of the Holy
   Cross, whereas in 1901-02 he restored (in fact mostly rebuilt) the nave
   and the main church facade.
   During the 1890 the dominant influence of St Brigitte's Church on
   Bolle's designs of Neo-Gothic buildings waned. He started designing
   churches with towers positioned laterally from the main facade (not in
   the axis) which is illustrated by the churches in Vrbovsko (1893-1904),
   Tounj (c 189397) and Dugo Selo (1899-1901). In the same period (1896) he
   designed a central church in Rude near Samobor which unfortunately was
   not built. The most interesting and the only significant Gothic central
   building (without dome) which Bolle managed to complete after the
   Evangelical church in Zagreb is the chapel of the Holy Cross, built in
   1893 on Illyrian Square in Zagreb.
   Between 1894 and 1897 Bolle worked on the restoration of the Greek
   Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Krizevci. With the main facade
   opened with a loggia, gable mosaics, representative interior with an
   iconostasis reminiscent of screens in English churches, the church in
   Krizevci is doubtlessly the most successful accomplishment in the
   Neo-Gothic style. After the restoration of this church, Bolle started
   the restoration of the Franciscan church in Ilok (1907-24). In all his
   restored buildings Bolle removed the elements of post-medieval periods,
   especially Baroque, which later brought him severe criticism. However,
   this does not change the fact that this architect brought the tradition
   of the great European architects of the 19(th) century, Viollet le Duc
   and Friedrich Schmidt, to Croatia, mostly in the Neo-Gothic segment of
   his oeuvre discussed in this paper.}},

   franca during the last fifty years, it has established a strong base to
   teach English as a foreign language (FL). In Turkey, however, such
   studies have increased in the last decade. The aims of this descriptive
   study are to compare the postgraduate programmes on teaching Turkish and
   English as a FL and to evaluate the similarities and differences between
   Turkish (Istanbul University, Dokuz Eylul University, Yildiz Teknik
   University) and British (Lancaster University, Newcastle University,
   University of Birmingham) universities in terms of course names, course
   credits, and course variation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article compares the logics and institutional consequences of urban
   government reform in the United States and in England. We focus on the
   politics of ideas, identifying four common visions of urban reform:
   efficient public interest management, improved representation, local
   political leadership, and metropolitan-wide governance. National
   pressure groups, locality effects, and the status of city charters and
   council constitutions are key factors mediating the direction and pace
   of reform. These are embedded in different institutional norms for city
   government, related to national political and governmental cultures. The
   strengths and weaknesses of both systems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid urbanization of the Industrial Revolution in 18th-19th century
   England presented new health challenges. Our aim is to investigate using
   English skeletal remains whether the living conditions for an urban
   working class group in the Industrial Revolution negatively impacted
   upon their skeletal growth compared with a population from a rural
   agrarian parish. The Industrial Revolution skeletal material is from St
   Martin's Churchyard, Birmingham (SMB), West Midlands. It dates primarily
   from the first half of the nineteenth century when Birmingham was a
   major manufacturing center. The rural group is from Wharram Percy (WP),
   North Yorkshire, and dates from 10th-19th century AD. The methodology
   involves plotting diaphyseal bone lengths versus dental age for
   subadults. No overall difference was found between the two populations
   in bone length-for-age among the 2- to 18-year cohort. However the
   younger parts of the SMB cohort were smaller than at WP; the opposite
   was true of the older parts of the cohort. Growth rate, as inferred from
   cross-sectional data, appeared greater at SMB than at WP. The only
   result consistent with expectations is the larger bone dimensions in
   young children from WP, but this likely reflects prolonged breastfeeding
   at WP not differences in urban and rural environments. That the
   deleterious health effects that we know accompanied the major transition
   in human society from a rural agrarian to an urban industrialized living
   environment should be little manifest in skeletal endochondral growth
   data is discouraging for those who would use such methodology to monitor
   health in earlier populations.}},

   1945-1949, and at Birmingham 1949-1974, is best known for his research
   on Pleistocene geology of the English Midlands. However, during the
   Second World War he became a distinguished military geologist. From May
   1941 to September 1943, based in Egypt, he used hydrogeology to guide
   development of potable water supplies for British forces operational in
   the Middle East and northern Africa. Recalled to the UK after campaign
   victory, from October 1943 he helped plan for the Allied liberation of
   Normandy by providing terrain evaluation (primarily through preparation
   of specialist maps and contribution of technical advice) relating to
   beach conditions, suitability of ground for the rapid construction of
   temporary airfields, and water supply. Following D-Day, 6 June 1944, he
   was based in northern France and later Belgium, and was involved with
   further water supply tasks, discussions on quarrying of aggregate, and
   assessment of soil conditions likely to influence off-road vehicle
   mobility or the siting of airfields and military depots, thus
   contributing to Allied victory in Europe in May 1945. Preparing to go
   into Germany, he was granted early demobilization to resume his academic
   career. Wartime achievements generated few of his hundred significant
   publications, but postwar influenced his inspirational teaching and
   academic leadership.}},

   and English municipal government between the eighteen-seventies and the
   nineteen-thirties, focusing specifically on the emergence of a new cadre

   research through the comparative case studies of Birmingham and

   he established a position as the interface between the local state and

Abstract = {{Henry W. Crosskey (1826-93), a late Victorian unitarian minister who
   served in Derby, Glasgow and Birmingham, is now best remembered for his
   involvement in Liberal politics and policy, especially education, as
   both an advocate and as a member of the Birmingham School Board. An
   eloquent preacher, he was also an important geologist, recognized both
   for his original research and for popularising the science and its
   impact on theology, and a revealing figure in the evolution of English
   unitarian thought. From his student days at Manchester College, Crosskey
   was a follower of his teacher, James Martineau, but, unlike Martineau,
   he advocated an active role for government, particularly local
   government, in promoting social well-being. In the political crises of
   1885-6, though differing from Gladstone on religious education,
   disestablishment, and home rule for Ireland, he was unable to follow
   Joseph Chamberlain, a member of his congregation, into alliance with the
   Conservative Party. His scientific convictions led to his emergence in
   later life as an admirer of the broad piety of the early unitarian
   theologian and scientist, Joseph Priestley, whose followers had warred
   with Martineau's disciples in the bitter mid century struggle between
   `Old' and `New' unitarianism, thus serving as a bridge between the two
   schools of interpretation. He is also an important reminder of the
   expanding demands, internal and external, of an urban pastorate in the
   later 19th century.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and aims. Although there has been increasing research
   attention to the concept of addiction careers and treatment careers,
   there are few standardised measures for assessing illicit drug using
   careers. A new instrument for mapping lifetime drug use history (LDUH)
   was used to assess transitions in the initial stages of heroin use
   careers among illicit drug users. Design and Methods. 58 lifetime heroin
   users completed a one-off researcher-administered interview in treatment
   settings in two English cities, London and Birmingham, about their
   histories of drug use, drug treatment and other key life events.
   Results. The sample reported initiating heroin use at a mean age of 21
   years and escalated to daily use by 23 years. On average, there was a
   gap of nearly 8 years before seeking treatment and at the time of
   interview the cohort averaged one-third of their heroin careers in
   treatment. However, there was marked variability across the group, with
   three discernible groups identified based on use patterns. While one
   group (n=21) showed consistent escalation in total quantity of heroin
   used across the first year, the second group had an intermittent pattern
   of use and the third group reported an unchanging monthly heroin use
   pattern. These groups differed in the time taken to initiate treatment
   and in the proportion of their heroin careers in active use. Discussion
   and Conclusions. The instrument was acceptable to research participants
   and identified important variability in onset and escalation factors in
   heroin careers. The implications for therapeutic interventions and for
   clinical use of the instrument are discussed.}},

   Home-based compared with hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation in a

Journal = {{HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the relative effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of a home-based programme of cardiac rehabilitation
   using the Heart Manual, with centre-based programmes. It also sought to
   explore the reasons for non-adherence to cardiac rehabilitation
   programmes.
   Design: An individually randomised trial, with minimisation for age,
   gender, ethnicity, initial diagnosis and hospital of recruitment.
   Participants were followed up after 6, 12 and 24 months by questionnaire
   and clinical assessment. Individual semistructured interviews were
   undertaken in the homes of a purposive sample of patients who did not
   adhere to their allocated programme, and focus groups were undertaken
   with groups of patients who adhered to the programmes.
   Setting: Four hospitals in predominantly inner-city, multi-ethnic,
   socio-economically deprived areas of the West Midlands in England, for 2
   years from 1 February 2002.
   Participants: A total of 525 patients who had experienced a myocardial
   infarction (MI) or coronary revascularisation within the previous 12
   weeks.
   Interventions: All the rehabilitation programmes included exercise,
   relaxation, education and lifestyle counselling. All patients were seen
   by a cardiac rehabilitation nurse prior to hospital discharge and
   provided with information about their condition and counselling about
   risk factor modification. The four centre-based programmes varied in
   length from nine sessions at weekly intervals of education, relaxation
   and circuit training to 24 individualised sessions over 12 weeks of
   mainly walking, fixed cycling and rowing with group-based education. The
   home-based programme consisted of an appropriate version of the Heart
   Manual, home visits and telephone contact. The Heart Manual was
   introduced to patients on an individual basis, either in hospital or on
   a home visit. Home visits by a nurse took place at approximately 1, 6
   and 12 weeks after recruitment, with a telephone call at 3 weeks. At the
   final visit, patients were encouraged to maintain their lifestyle
   changes and to continue with their exercise programme. Where needed,
   follow-up was made by a rehabilitation nurse who spoke Punjabi. An
   audiotape of an abridged version of the Heart Manual in Punjabi
   accompanied the manual for patients with a limited command of English.
   Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were smoking cessation, blood
   pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, exercise
   capacity measured by the incremental shuttle walking test and
   psychological status measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
   Scale (HADS). Secondary outcomes included self-reported diet, physical
   activity, cardiac symptoms and quality of life. Health service resource
   use and costs of rehabilitation programmes from health service and
   societal perspectives were also measured. Adherence to the physical
   activity element of the rehabilitation programmes was measured by
   questionnaire 6, 9 and 12 weeks.
   Results: No clinically or statistically significant differences were
   found in any of the primary or secondary outcome measures between the
   home- and centre-based groups. Significant improvements in total
   cholesterol, smoking prevalence, the HADS anxiety score, self-reported
   physical activity and diet were seen in both arms between baseline and
   the 6-month follow-up. Five or more contacts with a cardiac
   rehabilitation nurse were received by 96\% of home-based participants,
   whereas only 56\% of centre-based participants attended this many
   rehabilitation classes. The direct rehabilitation costs to the health
   service were significantly higher for the home-based programme ( mean
   cost 198 pound versus 157 pound for the centre-based programme), but
   when patient costs were included the mean cost of the centre-based arm
   rose to 182 pound. Patients' reasons for not taking up or adhering to
   cardiac rehabilitation were multifactorial and very individual. Other
   health problems limited some patients' ability to exercise. Most
   non-adherers found some aspects of their cardiac rehabilitation
   programme helpful. Many had adapted advice on rehabilitation and were
   continuing to exercise in other ways and had made lifestyle changes,
   particularly to their diet. The home- based patients' lack of motivation
   to exercise on their own at home was a major factor in non-adherence.
   The focus groups revealed little diversity of views among patients from
   each programme. Patients in the hospital programme enjoyed the
   camaraderie of group exercise and the home-based patients valued the
   wealth of information and advice in the Heart Manual.
   Conclusions: A home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme for low- to
   moderate-risk patients does not produce inferior outcomes compared with
   the traditional centre-based programmes. With the level of home visiting
   in this trial, the home-based programme was more costly to the health
   service, but with the difference in costs borne by patients attending
   centrebased programmes. Different reasons were given by home and
   hospital cardiac rehabilitation patients for not taking up or adhering
   to cardiac rehabilitation, with home-based patients often citing a lack
   of motivation to exercise at home. Social characteristics, individual
   patient needs and the location of cardiac rehabilitation programmes need
   to be taken into account in programme design to maximise participation.
   Research is recommended into cardiac rehabilitation in patients from
   ethnic minority groups; measurement tools to assess physical activity
   and dietary change; evaluating the Heart Manual in patients who decline
   centre-based cardiac rehabilitation; the implementation of homebased
   programmes in the UK; and strategies that sustain physical activity in
   the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is growing concern that moderate levels of outdoor air
   pollution may be associated with infant mortality, representing
   substantial loss of life- years. To date, there has been no
   investigation of the effects of outdoor pollution on infant mortality in
   the UK.
   Methods: Daily time- series data of air pollution and all infant deaths
   between 1990 and 2000 in 10 major cities of England: Birmingham,
   Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle,
   Nottingham and Sheffield, were analysed. City- specific estimates were
   pooled across cities in a fixed- effects meta- regression to provide a
   mean estimate.
   Results: Few associations were observed between infant deaths and most
   pollutants studied. The exception was sulphur dioxide (SO2), of which a
   10 mu g/m(3) increase was associated with a RR of 1.02 (95\% CI 1.01 to
   1.04) in all infant deaths. The effect was present in both neonatal and
   postneonatal deaths.
   Conclusions: Continuing reductions in SO2 levels in the UK may yield
   additional health benefits for infants.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To characterize habitual visual acuity, contrast sensitivity,
   spectacle use, and eye care utilization in a large sample of older
   adults residing in nursing homes.
   Methods: Of 33 nursing homes identified in Birmingham, Alabama, 17
   served as sites. Eligibility criteria included age 55 years or older,
   English-speaking, and Mini-Mental State Examination score of 13 or
   higher. Habitual distance and near visual acuity and contrast
   sensitivity were measured for each eye and binocularly. Residents and a
   family member/guardian were interviewed about spectacle use and eye care
   utilization. Medical records provided information on demographics,
   chronic medical conditions, date of last eye examination, duration of
   residence in the nursing home, and health insurance.
   Results: Of 380 enrollees, 57\% had distance visual acuity in the better
   eye worse than 20/40; 10\% had visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Near
   visual acuity was slightly worse on average by a line than distance
   acuity. Three-fourths of residents had abnormal binocular contrast
   sensitivity. The medical record had no record of or reference to an eye
   examination for 66\% of enrollees despite 90\% having health insurance.
   Conclusion: The high rate of visual impairment in nursing homes
   underscores the need to understand its causes and to evaluate
   interventions to address this public health challenge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the postlitigation history of an English nuisance
   case of 1858 concerning pollution of the river Tame caused by sewage
   from the city of Birmingham. This case is a classic citation that
   purports to illustrate the absence in English nuisance law of a social
   benefit defense for nuisance. As the court's judgment in law found in
   favor of an individual landowner against Birmingham, population 250,000,
   property rights were manifestly awarded where benefits were lower.
   Coase's theorem arguments would expect that postlitigation negotiations
   would ensue, and in this case such negotiations did occur but broke
   down. The legal conflict stretched on over nearly 40 years, while the
   pollution was, in practice, allowed to continue. The argument is made
   that the English court, in effect, by failing to enforce its decisions
   robustly, did take note of the calamitous social effects that would have
   followed a rigorous enforcement of the court's orders.}},

Title = {{Public Transport Accessibility Map of access to General Practitioners
   Surgeries in Longbridge, Birmingham, UK}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAPS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Pages = {{64-75}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an accessibility map (centred on -1.977 degrees,
   52.399 degrees with an area of 130.8 km(2) at 1: 50,000 scale) which is
   the culmination of one aspect of an accessibility planning exercise for
   a major redevelopment in the English West Midlands. `Accessibility
   Planning' as defined by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) is a new
   duty in the local authority Local Transport Plan (LTP) process-although
   accessibility and location allocation models are established
   quantitative methods in geography. The incorporation of accessibility
   planning techniques in the LTP process has raised their profile in
   transport planning generally, where they are steadily gaining ground.
   Accessibility planning is not yet at the core of local transport
   planning, since the approach differs significantly from traditional
   methods in both techniques employed and in general approach to `the
   transport problem'. Much traditional transport planning work is
   scheme-led; a new link or service is mooted, and established numerical
   modelling tools used to predict demand for the facility.
   Rather than taking travel demands as a starting point, Accessibility
   Planning (in the LTP sense) considers the reasons why people need to
   travel in the first place-to more effectively plan service delivery
   around revealed needs or demands. Specifically, the broader needs of a
   population are reviewed; employment, education, healthcare, leisure the
   whole range of opportunities and services. These destinations and the
   connecting transport networks are then analysed in a spatial context
   using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to show visually whether the
   population can access these key facilities.
   If this accessibility mapping exercise reveals that people cannot easily
   reach important destinations, the transport planner can use this
   evidence to argue for possible interventions-and use accessibility maps
   and models to test potential measures. Accessibility Planning also
   differs from the `classic' approach in that non-transport measures are
   considered too, with transport planners informing decisions by other
   professionals on location and delivery of services.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The objectives of this study were to describe the life
   experiences associated with migration to the UK and to explore in-depth
   information about the process of life adjustment to migration and the
   circumstances of mental health in Chinese immigrants living in a large
   city area.
   Method. A two-part research strategy using both quantitative and
   qualitative methods was employed. In the cross-sectional quantitative
   survey, 113 Chinese respondents completed a questionnaire investigating
   demographic factors, life experiences associated with migration,
   proficiency in the English language and mental health status. in the
   qualitative phase of the research, interviews were conducted with a
   further 24 immigrants to explore these factors in more depth.
   Results. In the questionnaire survey, over 60\% of the group reported
   symptoms of poor mental health. Qualitative research shows that for
   those who were employed in catering, psychological adjustment was
   heavily dependent on strong ties with the Chinese community and there
   was minimal contact with the host society. By contrast, those concerned
   with professional development experienced conflict as a result of a high
   perceived need for integration and a recognition of the problems
   associated with this.
   Conclusion. The psychological distress experienced by immigrants of
   Chinese origin continues to be a largely invisible cause for concern.}},

Title = {{Characteristics of Primary Care Trusts in financial deficit and surplus
   - a comparative study in the English NHS}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently the financial status of primary care trusts has
   come under considerable scrutiny by the government, and financial
   deficits have been blamed on poor local management of resources. This
   paper examines the factors that differ between those Primary Care Trusts
   (PCT) in financial deficit and those in surplus, using readily available
   data at PCT level. PCTs are the National Health Service organisations in
   England responsible for improving the health of their population,
   developing primary and community health services, and commissioning
   secondary care services.
   Methods: A descriptive comparative study using data from 58 PCTs; 29 in
   greatest financial surplus and 29 in greatest deficit in the English
   National Health Service.
   Results: Nearly half the study deficit PCTs ( 14 out of 29) are in the
   East of England and of the 29 surplus PCTs, five each are in Birmingham
   and Black Country Strategic Health Authority (SHA), and Greater
   Manchester SHA. The median population density of the deficit PCTs is
   almost seven times lower than that of surplus PCTs ( p = 0.004). Surplus
   PCTs predominantly serve deprived communities. Nearly half the surplus
   PCTs are `spearhead' PCTs compared to only one of the deficit PCTs.
   Percentage population increase by local authority of the PCT showed that
   on average deficit PCTs had 2.7 times higher change during 1982 - 2002
   (13.37\% for deficit and 4.94\% for surplus PCTs). Work pressure felt by
   staff is significantly higher in deficit PCTs, and they also reported
   working higher amount of extra hours due to work pressures. The
   proportion of dispensing general practitioners is significantly higher
   in deficit PCTs 40.5\% vs. 12.9\% ( p = 0.002). Deficit PCTs on average
   received  pound 123 less per head of registered population compared to
   surplus PCTs.
   Conclusion: The two groups of PCTs serve two distinct populations with
   marked differences between the two. Deficit PCTs tend to be in
   relatively affluent and rural areas. Poor management alone is unlikely
   to be the cause of deficits, and potential reasons for deficits
   including rurality and increased demand for health services in more
   affluent communities need further in-depth studies.}},

Abstract = {{Using a variety of archival sources, notably personnel records and
   municipal minute books, this article builds a picture of the work-life
   histories of rank-and-file police constables and firefighters in the
   English cities of Birmingham and Leicester, and contrasts the techniques
   of behavioural control adopted by their employers. By drawing on an
   expanding literature on the social history of public institutions, the
   article compares the experience of managing such disciplined and
   uniformed public services. The article demonstrates that municipal
   management combined insidious devices for controlling workers' behaviour
   with consensual and negotiated tactics deployed by workers aware of the
   tangible material benefits offered by a career in public service.
   Moreover, by placing the English experience of municipal policing and
   fire-fighting in an international context by focusing on the visits and
   writings made by prominent technical and social reformers, the article
   offers a framework within which comparative research can be undertaken.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the development of water engineering schemes in
   Wales in the late 19th and 20th centuries, concentrating mainly on
   water-supply schemes promoted by large English municipalities such as
   Birmingham and Liverpool, but also discussing hydro-electricity. It is
   argued that the first water engineering projects in Wales were informed
   by certain perceptions of the Welsh landscape and wider discourses
   regarding Britain's `Celtic Fringe', and that such concepts were used to
   promote ideas of water purity. Ideas of `progress' and `modernity'
   surrounding the changing of the landscape through water works are
   analysed, and how such notions were challenged in the 20th century is
   explored, particularly from conservationist and nationalist
   perspectives. In the second half of the 20th century, it is argued, a
   paradox emerges, whereby different ways of seeing or perceiving the
   landscape of Wales led to a divergence in the political dynamics
   surrounding water-supply projects and hydro-electric schemes.}},

   Political and managerial assessment of performance tends to focus on the

   considers how the members of a team of anti-social behaviour officers in

Abstract = {{This paper shows how software tools call be developed to interface with
   search engines and help linguists to make use of the world-wide web in
   their work. Two complementary tools ore explained and tested here,
   WebCorp, developed by the Research and Development Unit for English
   Studies, now in Birmingham, and WebPhraseCount, developed at Chemnitz.
   These tools can be used by advanced language learners as well as
   linguists interested in variation in English world-wide. This paper
   presents approaches to lexical and grammatical variation, from British
   to Fast African English, and discusses possible limitations of these
   approaches.(1).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin
   cancer, with unclear histogenesis. To date there is no consensus on the
   optimal, treatment of this neoplasm, with controversy surrounding the
   use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There are also limited data on
   biological behaviour and prognosis, with reported survival ranging from
   31\% at three years to 74\% at five years.
   Method: The medical records of 34 patients with a diagnosis of primary
   MCC, treated at two NHS trusts in Birmingham and Coventry, were
   reviewed. An extensive review of the English literature was also
   performed.
   Results: MCC occurred predominantly in Caucasians (97\%) with a mean age
   of 75 years. Identified risk factors were a previous history of SCC
   (37\%), BCC (18\%) and AK (20\%). Ten percent of patients showed
   evidence of immunocompromise. Most tumours were located on the
   extremity, where they reached a mean size of 2.1 cm. Fifty percent had
   regional metastasis during the course of their disease. A sub group
   analysis of the excision margins showed that a 2-cm excision margin,
   extending to the deep fascia, resulted in a 50\% incomplete excision
   rate and a 33\% local recurrence rate. In contrast a 3-cm margin
   including deep fascia resulted in no incomplete excisions and a 10.5\%
   local recurrence rate Prognosis was poor with a 40\% 3-year survival.
   Combining the data from two trusts has produced a relatively large
   series and highlighted differences in patient characteristics and
   management between the units. We advocate a 3-cm excision margin,
   including fascia wherever possible, combined with post-operative
   radiotherapy to offer the best chance of local control. Survival is
   fairly dismal and in keeping with the aggressive nature of this tumour.
   The respective roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain
   controversial. (c) 2006 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.

Abstract = {{Samples drawn from marriage registers in Birmingham and rural Norfolk,
   England, which report the occupational status for both the groom and his
   father, were matched with the 1851 and 1881 English censuses, which also
   contain occupational information. After performing several checks for
   selection bias, the author concludes: First, although most occupational
   mobility took place within 10 years of marriage-when the groom was
   roughly between the ages of 25 and 35-some continued after he turned 50.
   Second, approximately 35 percent of the men in each area eventually had
   an occupational status different from their fathers, and about 30
   percent changed occupational status over their careers, belying the
   stereotype of impenetrable walls between classes in Victorian England.
   Third, upward occupational mobility seemed to slow in both regions as
   the period under consideration progressed. Fourth, although occupational
   mobility rates overall were comparable in these urban and rural areas,
   it was much easier for an individual to rise from an unskilled to a
   skilled status in Birmingham than it was in Norfolk. Fifth, and perhaps
   most surprising, literacy had a greater effect on social mobility in
   rural Norfolk than in urban Birmingham.}},

Abstract = {{This essay represents essentially a comparative investigation of Athol
   Fugard's The Island and Femi Osofisan's Tegonni, an African Antigone,
   two African adaptations of Sophocles's Antigone. In the course of
   exploring the two texts however, I have found myself delving into some
   salient debates in postcolonial theory. While Karin Barber's ``African
   Language Literatures and Postcolonial Criticism,{''} an essay in which
   the Birmingham-based scholar argues that postcolonial criticism, much
   like Commonwealth criticism before it, has continued to repress and
   marginalize works in African language literatures, this essay pushes
   that argument further by suggesting that even for literatures of English
   language expression, the discursive practice of postcolonialism
   perpetrates an intense politics of selection and exclusion,
   re-circulating only those texts which that into its pre-set paradigm.
   The essay proceeds from a discussion of these issues into a detailed
   consideration of the two texts.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To explore the positions towards their relatives' heavy drinking
   adopted by close family members of a community sample of untreated heavy
   drinkers over a period of four years.
   Design. Detailed interview and questionnaire study of a sample of close
   family members and the heavy drinkers to whom they were related,
   interviewed three times at intervals of two years over a period of four
   years.
   Sample. Twenty-five close family members of 25 heavy drinkers drawn from
   a community cohort of 500 heavy drinkers in the English West Midlands.
   This is a follow-up of 25 of the 50 family members included in an
   earlier report (Orford, J., Dalton, S., Hartney, E., Ferrins-Brown, M.,
   Kerr, C., \& Maslin, J. ( 2002). The close relatives of untreated heavy
   drinkers: Perspectives on heavy drinking and its effects. Addiction
   Research and Theory, 10, 439 - 463.).
   Data. Perceived Benefits and Drawbacks of drinking checklist ( family
   members and heavy drinkers); Readiness to Change questionnaire ( family
   members and heavy drinkers); Coping Questionnaire ( family member only);
   semi-structured interview ( family members).
   Findings. A wide range of positions towards their relatives' heavy
   drinking continued to be evident over time. The downsides to relatives'
   drinking were widely recognised and a minority continued to see the
   drinking as very problematic. The benefits of relatives' heavy drinking
   were also widely recognised. A minority consistently saw their
   relatives' heavy drinking as benign, and a number of others came to see
   drinking positively as it reduced over time. The largest group continued
   to be ambivalent. Family members as a group became more positive about
   the drinking over time than did their heavy drinking relatives, and
   became less inclined than their relatives to desire change. Acceptance
   that drinking was already less than it once was, and sometimes family
   members' own heavy drinking, were amongst the factors operating to allow
   family members to preserve a positive view.
   Conclusions. Close family members are often caught in a complex set of
   dilemmas about what position to take in relation to their relatives'
   heavy drinking. For a number of understandable reasons, they take a more
   or less benign view of their relatives' heavy drinking.}},

   marriages not available in standard sources. Police officers were
   respectable working-class men expected to uphold the reputation of the

   appear in police records in Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester Their
   affairs, separations, cohabitation, and other unorthodox marital
   arrangements clearly demonstrate that attempts to impose a strict legal
   model of marriage on police officers could not displace the more
   flexible ideas of matrimony still common to respectable working-class

Abstract = {{A growing number of post-industrial cities are utilizing Sport
   initiatives to present an attractive image to potential tourists.
   Despite insufficient evidence of (and explanations for) image effects,
   it is widely assumed that these initiatives have the capacity to enhance
   city images. The aim of this paper is to explore the value of sport as a
   reimaging theme for the coil temporary city destination. This assessment
   is based primarily on evidence regarding the effects of initiatives
   adopted by three English cities: Birmingham, Manchester, and Sheffield.
   The findings Suggest that, although sport reimaging does exhibit some
   advantageous qualities, there are also significant problems associated
   with this mode of place marketing.}},

Abstract = {{As cold weather is an ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk factor,
   year-to-year variations of the level of IHD mortality may be partly
   determined by inter-annual variations in winter climate. This paper
   investigates whether there is any association between the level of IHD
   mortality for three English counties and the winter North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO), which exerts a fundamental control on the nature of
   the winter climate over Western Europe. Correlation and regression
   analysis was used to explore the nature of the association between IHD
   mortality and a climate index (CI) that represents the interaction
   between the NAO and temperature across England for the winters 1974 -
   1975 to 1989 - 1999. Statistically significant inverse associations
   between the CI and the level of IHD mortality were found. Generally,
   high levels of winter IHD mortality are associated with a negative CI,
   which represents winters with a strong negative phase of the NAO and
   anomalously low temperatures across England. Moreover, the nature of the
   CI in the early stages of winter appears to exert a fundamental control
   on the general level of winter IHD mortality. Because winter climate is
   able to explain a good proportion of the interannual variability of
   winter mortality, long-lead forecasting of winter IHD mortality appears
   to be a possibility. The integration of climate-based health forecasts
   into decision support tools for advanced general winter emergency
   service and capacity planning could form the basis of an effective
   adaptive strategy for coping with the health effects of harsh winters.}},

   are present in the city of Birmingham in the English Midlands. Estimates
   of road and rail noise levels were made using established sound
   propagation models and were combined with data on noise generated from
   the city's airport. Demographic details from the 1991 UK Census provided
   information on population age, ethnic make-up and deprivation. No
   relationship was established between noise exposure and population age,
   and there was only rather weak evidence of an association between noise
   exposure and ethnicity. Similarly weak disparities were observed in
   estimated noise exposures and levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The
   implications of these findings with regard to possible efforts to reduce
   urban noise levels are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the pattern of bloodstream infection (BSI) can help
   determine antibiotic prescribing policy and infection control
   procedures. Data on 2364 consecutive episodes of BSI at Birmingham
   Children's Hospital over 7 years were collected prospectively. A total
   of 1224 (51.8\%) episodes were community-acquired, but only 281 (11.9\%)
   were in previously healthy children. Intravascular devices (IVDs) were
   the most common source of infection, accounting for 48.9\% of episodes.
   Gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria accounted for
   66.2\%, 31.3\% and 0.4\% of isolates, and 2.2\% were yeasts.
   Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci
   accounted for over 50\% of all isolates. Of these, only enterococci were
   predominantly hospital-acquired. Neisseria meningitidis was the most
   common cause of community-acquired BSI in previously healthy children.
   Of cases of meningococcaemia, 55.6\% were diagnosed by PCR alone.
   Antibiotic resistance, especially in Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and
   enterococci, was more common than in earlier studies of BSI in children,
   and varied between specialties. The overall mortality rate directly
   attributable to infection was 2.4\%, but was higher in neonates (6.2\%)
   and in previously healthy children with community-acquired infections
   (5.3\%). Conclusion:intravascular devices have emerged as the commonest
   source of bloodstream infection in children, leading to marked
   similarities in the species distribution of blood culture isolates
   across specialties other than General Paediatrics, and explaining the
   low overall mortality rate. Antibiotic resistance was found frequently
   in most commonly isolated pathogens, but differences between specialties
   suggest the existence of local risk factors, some of which might be
   amenable to infection control interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Bishop Mark Santer was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge. Following
   ordination in the Church of England, he was engaged in theological
   education until his appointment as Fellow and Dean of Clare College,
   Cambridge in 1967. He was consequently made the Principal of Westcott
   House, Cambridge, in 1973 and consecrated the Suffragan Bishop of the
   London Episcopal area of Kensington in 1981, where he served until he
   was translated to the Diocese of Birmingham in 1987. Bishop Santer is
   now in retirement.
   In this paper, Bishop Santer explores the issue of authority, which
   haunted English and European Church history in the early 16(th) century.
   The constant stresses between local, national and international
   interests frequently informed the rise of conflict, when these various
   interests were in tension. He goes on to discuss the difficulties that
   national Churches have experienced in subsequent history. Thomas More's
   principles sought to provide an answer to the statement of the Nicene
   Creed ``I believe in the Catholic Church{''}. Drawing from his
   experience on the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission,
   Bishop Santer considers that the questions posed by More are unavoidable
   in the quest for Church unity.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the seasonality of ischaemic heart disease
   (IHD) mortality and temperature is explored for the purpose of
   evaluating the climate-based predictability of the magnitude and timing
   of the annual IHD mortality peak for 5 English counties. Seasonality is
   described by the amplitude (magnitude) and phase (timing) of the first
   harmonic of the annual cycle of IHD mortality and mean and minimum
   temperature. Study results reveal a positive association between the
   amplitude of the annual IHD mortality cycle and temperature seasonality
   such that years with an exaggerated mortality peak are associated with
   years characterised by strong temperature seasonality. Overall, the
   timing of the annual mortality peak is positively associated with the
   timing of the lowest temperatures. Such findings provide some optimism
   for exploring the development of experimental climate-based
   health-forecasting models. This is because the simple
   climate-seasonality diagnostics presented here provide a fundamental
   source of predictability of the magnitude and timing of the annual IHD
   mortality peak.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of classroom communication, there is a premium on the
   clarity of the message. and instructors will typically employ multiple
   linguistic cues to highlight information structure. Using a model of
   intonation in discourse {[}Brazil, D. (1986). The communicative value of
   intonation in English. Birmingham, England: University of Birmingham,
   English Language Research. Brazil, D. (1997). The communicative value of
   intonation in English. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.], this
   paper examines the use of intonational paragraphs as an organizational
   tool in the teaching discourse of native speaker teaching assistants and
   normative speaker international teaching assistants at a North American
   university. Analysis of the native speaker data presents evidence of
   intonational paragraphs defined by phonological criteria and used by the
   speakers to underscore local and global information structure.
   Comparative analysis of the parallel normative speaker data shows a
   considerably weaker control of intonational structure and a disturbance
   in prosodic composition that materially affects the comprehensibility of
   the discourse for native speaker bearers. The paper closes with a
   discussion of some of the implications of this study for international
   teaching assistant programs. (C) 2003 The American University. Published

Title = {{Comparing the use of hydrogel dressings to lanolin ointment with

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the use of hydrogel dressings for the prevention
   and treatment of nipple soreness in lactating women as compared with the
   common intervention of lanolin ointment. The hypothesis was as follows:
   Participants using hydrogel dressings as a preventive measure for nipple
   soreness will experience greater pain relief and a lower rate of nipple
   wounds as compared with the control group. The secondary hypothesis was
   that the reduction of nipple soreness in the treatment group would
   produce a longer duration of breastfeeding as compared with the control
   group.
   Design: A multicentered, prospective, randomized controlled clinical
   trial evaluating a sample of 106 lactating mothers.
   Setting: Study sites were the University of Alabama Medical Center at
   Birmingham (an inner-city teaching hospital) and Northeast Health System
   (a community hospital in Beverly, Massachusetts).
   Participants: Participants were older than age 18, fluent in English,
   and had an operational telephone in the residence. Other inclusion
   criteria were singleton, vaginal deliveries; no prior breastfeeding
   experience; and written informed consent.
   Interventions: Participants were randomized to either the lanolin
   ointment or the hydrogel dressings group and received instructions
   specific to their assignment. All participants received breastfeeding
   education provided by a board-certified lactation consultant.
   Main Outcome Measures: During the initial 12 study days, participants
   identified pain intensity using a numeric pain intensity scale and
   verbal descriptor scale. Subjective data were collected via
   self-reported skin assessments of the bilateral breasts, nipples, and
   areolae. Breastfeeding duration was established by a follow-up telephone
   call at 2 months.
   Results: The hydrogel dressings group had significantly greater
   reduction in pain score mean values at baseline, on study Day 10, and on
   study Day 12 in comparison to the control group. Participants using the
   hydrogel dressings discontinued treatment sooner than participants in
   the lanolin ointment group. The lanolin ointment group had eight breast
   infections, whereas the hydrogel dressings group had none.
   Conclusion: Hydrogel dressings are a safe, available treatment that
   provided soreness than the common intervention of lanolin ointment.}},

Title = {{Home-based versus hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial
   infarction or revascularisation: design and rationale of the Birmingham
   Rehabilitation Uptake Maximisation Study (BRUM): a randomised controlled
   trial {[}ISRCTN72884263]}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cardiac rehabilitation following myocardial infarction
   reduces subsequent mortality, but uptake and adherence to rehabilitation
   programmes remains poor, particularly among women, the elderly and
   ethnic minority groups. Evidence of the effectiveness of home-based
   cardiac rehabilitation remains limited. This trial evaluates the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of home-based compared to
   hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation.
   Methods/design: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of home-based
   compared with hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation in four hospitals
   serving a multi-ethnic inner city population in the United Kingdom was
   designed. The home programme is nurse-facilitated, manual-based using
   the Heart Manual. The hospital programmes offer comprehensive cardiac
   rehabilitation in an outpatient setting.
   Patients: We will randomise 650 adult, English or Punjabi-speaking
   patients of low-medium risk following myocardial infarction, coronary
   angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft who have been referred for
   cardiac rehabilitation.
   Main outcome measures: Serum cholesterol, smoking cessation, blood
   pressure, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, distance walked on
   Shuttle walk-test measured at 6, 12 and 24 months. Adherence to the
   programmes will be estimated using patient self-reports of activity.
   In-depth interviews with non-attendees and non-adherers will ascertain
   patient views and the acceptability of the programmes and provide
   insights about non-attendance and aims to generate a theory of
   attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. The economic analysis will measure
   National Health Service costs using resource inputs. Patient costs will
   be established from the qualitative research, in particular how they
   affect adherence.
   Discussion: More data are needed on the role of home-based versus
   hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients following myocardial
   infarction and revascularisation, which would be provided by the
   Birmingham Rehabilitation Uptake Maximisation Study (BRUM) study and has
   implications for the clinical management of these patients. A novel
   feature of this study is the inclusion of non-English Punjabi speakers.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies in the USA have noted inequities with regard to the
   socioeconomic status or racial character of communities and their
   relative exposure to environmental disamenities. In this paper the
   authors focus particularly on the environmental equity of air pollution
   in the English city of Birmingham. Using statistical methodologies they
   examine the pattern of exposure to two key air pollutants: carbon
   monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO,) across certain population
   groups in the city. Estimated emission levels of CO and NO2 were mapped
   by using modelled associations between vehicle densities and measured
   emissions at existing monitoring stations. These data were input to a
   geographical information system (GIS) for subsequent comparisons with
   population maps. Three types of variables were considered to distinguish
   possibly disadvantaged populations: age profile, ethnic make-up, and
   poverty indicators. From the 1991 Census, relevant statistics were
   derived for each enumeration district in the city. No relationship could
   be established on the age variable (that is, neither children nor
   pensioners appear to differ from the general population in their likely
   exposure patterns). However, there was a striking relationship between
   modelled emissions and poverty indicators and ethnicity. The effects are
   difficult to separate out but there is strong evidence to suggest that
   the two factors (poverty and ethnicity) operate in an independent
   manner. The implications of these findings, with regard to the causes of
   the disparities and the likely impacts of possible efforts to improve
   air quality in Birmingham, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies dominance in every day conversation has been
   measured by the distribution between speakers of various interactional
   features, including topic control, interruptions and overlaps, and
   amount of speech. This paper reassesses the indicators of dominance used
   in these studies and proposes a framework of analysis that treats
   dominance as a multidimensional construct with sequential, participatory
   and quantitative aspects. It also attempts to determine a relative
   saliency among the three dimensions by proposing that sequential
   dominance, or one speaker's tendency to control the actions of the other
   speaker within the exchange structure of a conversation, is the most
   significant dimension on the basis that it is most closely related to
   topic control. The framework and problems in its application are
   illustrated with conversational data gathered in a study of Japenese L1
   and English L2 conversations between male and female speakers of
   Japanese. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on late Middle Pleistocene interglacials in Britain has
   shown that sites formerly attributed to the Hoxnian include
   representatives of two different interglacials, which have been
   correlated with Oxygen Isotope Stages 11 and 9. Palynology has long been
   used to characterize and correlate temperate sequences in Britain.
   However, the quality of the palynological record is considerably better
   in lacustrine sequences than in fluvial and estuarine sediments; the
   former have longer sequences and higher resolution, whereas more rapid
   deposition in fluvial and estuarine environments leads to sequences
   representing only fragments of interglacials. The latter type of site,
   however, is more likely to have multi-proxy evidence and to be readily
   fitted into a stratigraphical framework. The problems are reviewed in
   the light of new work in the West Midlands, where some of the most
   complete British late Middle Pleistocene lacustrine sequences are
   preserved, Lacustrine sites here have a strong affinity with `Hoxnian'
   sites of the `type' area in East Anglia. A critical question remains as
   to whether the two interglacials conflated under the term Hoxnian can be
   separately characterized in terms of their pollen assemblages. Details
   of lacustrine sequences in the North Birmingham area and East Anglia
   show remarkable similarities, perhaps suggesting that the same
   interglacial is recorded in all of them. As many of these sites are
   thought to be kettle holes or glacially overdeepened basins, the first
   interglacial following the Anglian glaciation is the most likely to be
   represented, suggesting that all the lacustrine `Hoxnian' sites might
   date from OIS 11. In areas not glaciated since the Anglian,
   interglacials after OIS I I are likely to be represented only by
   fragmentary, non-lacustrine sequences, difficult if not impossible to
   separate using palynology alone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an unusual and potentially
   aggressive cancer of the skin. There is no consensus regarding the
   optimal therapeutic approach, and the relative roles of surgery,
   radiotherapy, and chemotherapy still are controversial The aim of this
   study is to analyze the roles of these therapeutic options.
   Methods: The medical records of 16 patients with a diagnosis of
   localized, primary MCC treated at the University of Alabama at
   Birmingham were reviewed. An extensive review of the English-language
   literature also was performed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
   develop the survival curves. Comparisons were made using Fisher's exact
   test. Significance was defined as P < .05.
   Results: MCC presented primarily in Caucasians (98.3\%) with a median
   age of 69 years. Immunosuppressive therapy appeared to play a role in
   the development of this cancer. In the UAB experience, 3-year actuarial
   survival was 31\%. The only factor significantly associated with overall
   survival was the stage of disease at presentation: median survivals were
   97 vs. 15 months for stages I and II, respectively (log-rank, P = .02).
   From the literature review, adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with a
   reduced risk of local recurrence (P < .00001).
   Conclusions: MCC is an aggressive cancer, with a high tendency for local
   recurrence and distant spread. Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy appear
   to provide optimal local control. The role of chemotherapy remains to be
   defined.}},

Abstract = {{Objective.-To present recent advances in the use of molecular markers in
   diagnosis, in prognosis, in early detection, in novel therapies, and in
   understanding the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia.
   Data and Literature Sources.-A review of studies of molecular markers in
   colorectal neoplasia, published in English and available on MEDLINE and
   BioMednet, indicates that molecular markers are being increasingly
   studied to predict clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal
   adenocarcinoma (CRC). We have used this resource, together with our
   published and unpublished observations at the University of Alabama at
   Birmingham, to provide an overview of translational research related to
   molecular markers in colorectal: neoplasia.
   Conclusions.-Currently, the prognosis of patients with CRC is predicted
   primarily on the basis of clinicopathologic staging; however,
   pathologists and oncology surgeons have recently begun to investigate
   the use of molecular markers to diagnose and/or understand the
   progression of CRC. In recent years, much has been learned about the
   molecular events responsible for the development of CRC. Also, several
   studies have reported the implication of some molecular markers in
   metastasis and tumor aggression and their usefulness in predicting
   clinical outcome. in this article, we discuss the use of specific
   molecular markers, including tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72),
   carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and oncofetal tumor antigens (Lewis X
   and Y) in diagnosis and as targets for novel therapies, as well as the
   phenotypic expression of bcl-2, mucin antigens (MUC1 and MUC2), and
   nuclear accumulation of p53 in predicting the clinical outcome of
   patients with CRC. We also review the ways in which molecular markers
   may aid the early detection of colorectal neoplasia and promote our
   understanding of the earliest changes in colorectal neoplasia.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, Britain celebrated the centenary of the birth of Noel Coward,
   the ``Master of the well-made play{''} in the first half of the 20th
   century: His statue was unveiled in the foyer of the Royal Theatre of
   Drury Lane by hist friend, The Queen Mother. Several conferences were
   held, notably at the University of Birmingham (November 1-2,1999). The
   Noel Coward Society was launched. Several of his plays were revived,
   including Private Lives at the Royal National Theatre. The Centenary
   Celebration (December 12,1999 at the Savoy Theatre) presided over by
   Richard Attenborough, featuring Judy Campbell, John Mills, and some of
   the greatest living British actors. His style, iconoclast in it
   modernity, led Noel Coward to open the way to the great renewal of
   English drama after 1956. Harold Pinter has acknowledged common points
   between his own plays and Noel Cowards's, and thus concluded his
   appraisal: ``Noel Coward has created his own world, the world of Coward,
   an abstraction which has become his own territory. It is a marvelous
   achievement{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Whether asthma morbidity in minority groups can be reduced by
   preventative health care measures delivered in the relevant ethnic
   dialects requires further evaluation. This study reports clinical
   outcomes and quality of life from a community based project
   investigating white European (WIE) and Indian subcontinent (ISC) ethnic
   groups with asthma living in deprived inner city areas of Birmingham,
   UK.
   Methods-Six hundred and eighty nine asthmatic subjects (345 WIE, 344
   ISC) of mean (SD) age 34.5 (15) years (range 11-59) and mean forced
   expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 80\% predicted were
   interviewed in English, Punjabi, Hindi, or Urdu. Subjects randomised to
   the active limb of a prospective, open, randomised, controlled, parallel
   group, 12 month follow up study underwent individually based asthma
   education and optimisation of drug therapy with four monthly follow up
   (active intervention). Control groups were seen only at the beginning
   and end of the study. Urgent or emergency interactions with primary and
   secondary health care (clinical outcomes) and both cross sectional and
   longitudinal data from an Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)
   were analysed.
   Results-Clinical outcomes were available for 593 subjects. Fewer of the
   active intervention group consulted their GP (41.8\% versus 57.8\%, odds
   ratio (OR) 0.52 (95\% CI 0.37 to 0.74)) or were prescribed antibiotics
   (34.9\% versus 51.2\%, OR 0.51 (95\% CI 0.36 to 0.72)), but by ethnicity
   statistically significant changes occurred only in the W/E group with
   fewer also attending A\&E departments and requiring urgent home visits.
   Active intervention reduced the number of hospital admissions (10 versus
   30), GP consultations (341 versus 476), prescriptions of rescue oral
   steroids (92 versus 177), and antibiotics (220 versus 340), but again
   significant improvements by ethnicity only occurred in the active WIE
   group. AQLQ scores were negatively skewed to the higher values;
   regression analysis showed that lower values were associated with ISC
   ethnicity. Longitudinal changes (for 522 subjects) in the mean AQLQ
   scores were small but statistically significant for both ethnic groups,
   with scores improving in the active and worsening in the control groups.
   Conclusions-Active intervention only improved clinical outcomes in the
   WIE group. AQLQ scores, although lower in the ISC group, were improved
   by active intervention in both ethnic groups.}},

Abstract = {{This article is the fifth in a regular series on discoveries made during
   emergency recording work by some of the national agencies. As in
   previous years, there appears to be no shortage of unexpected
   discoveries to be recorded, such as a medieval hall house in
   Carmarthenshire and some fascinating nineteenth-century industrial
   survivals, including a coffin-furniture maker in Birmingham and a
   printer in Denbigh. Regular readers may notice that schools have
   featured in all but one of the past five years. Along with some other
   types of institutional buildings, schools are particularly vulnerable to
   change, especially when small buildings may become redundant as a result
   of economies of scale. As ever, we are most grateful for their help in
   providing information and illustrations to Richard Suggett of the Royal
   Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of England, now of
   English Heritage. The editor would welcome comments on the value of this

Abstract = {{Anecdotal evidence suggests that adults who move from one dialect area
   to another begin to acquire some of the speech characteristics of the
   second dialect (or ``D2{''}). We put this observation to an empirical
   test in the present study by examining the speech of Canadians who have
   moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Speech samples produced by these people,
   as well as by native Alabamans and Canadians who had not emigrated were
   rated by two groups of listeners. This form of evaluation allowed us to
   determine whether dialect acquisition, if any, was perceptible. The fact
   that listeners from both Canada and Alabama reliably rated the speech of
   Canadians who had moved to Alabama as exhibiting an intermediate degree
   of ``American accent{''} indicates that adults can indeed acquire the
   phonetic aspects of a D2 to the extent that listeners from both the
   first dialect and D2 areas can distinguish them from other native
   speakers of either dialect. A follow-up analysis allowed us to pinpoint
   some specific phonetic properties of the migrant group's speech that may
   have played a role in the listeners' judgments. In several respects
   these findings parallel the results of studies of second-language
   phonetic learning in adults. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Although health care systems around the world are undergoing rapid
   changes, there is an absence of comparative studies of how these changes
   affect nurses' well-being and work life. The purpose of this study was
   (i) to identify and describe possible differences between the
   psyche-social work environments of English and Swedish mental health
   nurses, and (ii) to attempt to explain these differences. 1016
   psychiatric nurses from Stockholm (Sweden) and Birmingham (England)
   responded to a postal questionnaire on their psyche-social work
   environment and feelings of professional fulfilment, mental energy and
   work-related exhaustion. The study was given ethical clearance in
   Stockholm and Birmingham. Results indicated that while the English
   nurses rated their organizational well-being more favourably, Swedish
   psychiatric nurses reported greater individual well-being than their
   counterparts. Multiple regression analyses indicated that self-esteem
   was important for explaining mental energy and work-related exhaustion,
   but less so for explaining professional fulfilment, which was predicted
   primarily by organizational factors. When controlling for self-esteem,
   which was higher amongst the Swedish nurses, the differences in
   professional fulfilment and mental health were no longer significant.
   Reasons for the differences in self-esteem and experiences of the
   workplace are discussed. Low response rate may have contributed to a
   selection bias.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing proportion of change to the built environments of Western
   countries consists of adaptations of existing physical forms. Many
   changes are small-scale and piecemeal, but cumulatively they have a
   major impact on the physical character of the environment. This paper
   considers the physical changes that have taken place in one of the most
   extensive types of area in English cities: the suburbs created by
   private enterprise between the two world wars. Within each of the two
   cities studied, Birmingham and London, the form and density of the
   original development were major factors influencing the distribution of
   additional dwellings, demolitions and modifications of existing houses,
   and the types of new dwelling constructed. Between the mid 1950s and the
   mid 1960s in London, but a few years later in Birmingham, the insertion
   of additional houses by developers was the main type of change. From the
   early 1970s, individual householders became major instigators of change
   to existing houses, especially in London, where incomes rose more
   rapidly. House extensions were an important element in this change,
   despite the decline in household size. The large majority of planning
   applications for changes to existing houses, but only about one-half of
   those for the construction of additional dwellings, were approved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Few stud es have attempted to analyse the organisational
   aspects of the workplace that may affect the well-being of psychiatrists
   and even fewer have offered insights into what a positive workplace
   might look like. This study provides ari outline of such a workplace,
   with reference to individual and organisational factors. In addition, a
   comparison is made between two European cities to check for cultural
   differences,
   Method Three hundred and eighty psychiatrists from Stockholm and
   Birmingham responded to a previously tested questionnaire on their work
   environment.
   Results Predictors of a positive workplace for psychiatrists were: high
   self-esteem, satisfactory support with work-related problems; lower
   perceived workload, positive view of leadership, low work-related
   exhaustion and having a sense of participation in the organisation.
   There were few cultural differences.
   Conclusions Measures should be taken to improve leadership skills for
   managers, to offer more support for work-related problem, End to allow
   psychiatrists to participate more in the organisation.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Hospital admission rates for asthma have been higher for
   Asian (Indian subcontinent, ISC) ethnic minority groups in the UK than
   for white Europeans (W/E). As this may in part be due to differences in
   the uptake or delivery of preventative health care strategies, the
   extent to which targeted education and treatment programmes reach these
   groups needs to be determined.
   Methods-Six hundred and eighty nine asthmatic subjects (345 W/E, 344
   ISC) of mean (SD) age 33.5 (15) years (range 11-59) and mean forced
   expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 80\% predicted from districts of
   high ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation within inner city
   Birmingham were reviewed in the appropriate dialect (English, Punjabi,
   Hindi, Urdu) in a community based study.
   Results-Data adjusted for age and analysed separately for men (M) and
   women (F) showed no significant differences in the numbers reporting
   previous asthma education, assessment of delivery techniques, or being
   taught about medications, but there were significant differences for
   advice on trigger factors (M: 52\% vs 42\%; F: 56\% vs 42\%),
   recognition of symptoms (M: 51\% vs 43\%; F: 53\% vs 33\%), and
   ownership of peak flow meters (M: 35\% vs 22\%; F: 36\% vs 24\%) for W/E
   and ISC groups, respectively. Antiinflammatory asthma medications were
   highly prescribed, but self reported drug compliance (M: 73\% vs 62\%),
   understanding medications (F: 59\% vs 39\%), and self management (F:
   23\% vs 12\%) varied significantly. Asthma follow up in the community
   was low for both groups with more of the ISC subjects also being
   followed up by hospital.
   Conclusions-The management of both ethnic groups has centred on drug
   prescription, delivery techniques and compliance, but has been
   deficient, particularly in the ISC group, in developing understanding of
   the disease and self management.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the outcome of a project to code the
   complementation patterns of all the verbs in Collins COBUILD English
   Dictionary (1995). COBUILD stands for `Collins and Birmingham University
   international Language Database'. The coding is based on the Bank of
   English corpus at COBUILD and uses a simple notation based on words and
   word-classes rather than traditional functional categories. The result
   of this exercise is a list of verb patterns, with a complete list of all
   the verbs in a corpus of 250 million words that have each pattern. It is
   found that the verbs that share a pattern fall into groups based on
   meaning. This grammar is the first pedagogic grammar to integrate syntax
   and lexis using corpus data. The grammar is used to explore traditional
   grammatical categories such as Object, Complement, etc. These are found
   to be inadequate to account for the actual behaviour of verbs. Finally,
   the paper explores the possibility of using a pattern grammar to analyse
   naturally-occurring discourse.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to assess the quality of information
   leaflets produced by NHS dental practices based in high density
   multi-racial areas within the city of Birmingham.
   Method All of the 41 general dental practices based in ten Birmingham
   electoral wards with high concentrations of ethnic minorities were
   approached for a copy of their practice leaflet. Each leaflet was
   assessed in terms of: 1. overall presentation, 2. general information,
   and 3. information specifically relevant to the ethnic minorities.
   Results Seventy-eight per cent (32) of practices currently produce
   information leaflets. Compliance with specific NHS regulations ranged
   from 3\% to 97\%; 41\% (13) of leaflets had one or more sections written
   in a minority language. Although ethnic minority languages were spoken
   by staff in three-quarters of the practices, less than one third
   specified this. Only one leaflet contained information on arrangements
   for non-English speaking patients.
   Conclusion. Recommendations are made concerning the quality and content
   of practice leaflets for practices based in high density multi-racial
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of the study were to assess and compare the social
   characteristics, prevalence of disease, health needs, dependency and use
   of health services by elderly people in the different ethnic groups
   living in an inner city. A prevalence study was conducted using a
   questionnaire administered to people aged 65 years and over living at
   home, selected from the registers of inner city general practices in
   West Birmingham. Contact was made with 736 individuals from the original
   sample of 1,450 names, and completed questionnaires were obtained from
   669 individuals (297 men, 372 women). Respondents were divided by place
   of birth into four groups: UK, Asia, West Indies, and `Other'. Outcome
   measures were demographic data, language, household composition,
   prevalence of disease and health problems, help with activities of daily
   living, and contact with and knowledge of community health services. We
   found that those born in the UK were likely to be older, female,
   unmarried and living alone. In the Asian group, only 15\% spoke English
   and 59\% lived in a household with more than three other people compared
   with 4\% in both the UK and West Indian groups. Hypertension was more
   common in West Indians, arthritis in Asians and diabetes mellitus more
   common in both groups than in the UK group. Asians were more likely to
   complain of poor vision. The level of dependency was similar in all
   groups despite age differences. Contact with community health services
   was low among Asians who also had a low awareness of the availability of
   these services.
   The conclusions from the study were that the average age of elderly
   individuals in ethnic minority groups is less than that of the
   indigenous population, making direct comparison difficult. Nevertheless,
   they have a higher prevalence of age-related disease and a similar level
   of dependency. They are less well served by, and have little knowledge
   of the existence of, community health services. For older Asians,
   difficulty in communicating with English-speaking health personnel is a
   major barrier to effective health care. Access to health care by older
   people from ethnic minorities needs to be improved, and services
   developed in a more culturally sensitive manner.}},

   there were also significant differences. Consideration is also given to
   some of the influences shaping the images projected by these cities

   Outcome measures D-call of information and use of, and views on, the
   written and tape recorded summaries.
   Results-Parents who received the tape recording showed no increase in
   recall of the summary's content six weeks later. Forty three per cent of
   English speaking parents favoured the tape recorded summary, as did 89\%
   of Urdu/Punjabi speaking parents.
   Conclusions-Tape recorded summaries were popular with parents, but other
   methods are needed to help parents, especially those whose first

Abstract = {{Objective: To asssess the kind of woman who chooses to use a long acting
   implant contraceptive in England and make subjective comparisons between
   these women and those choosing implant contraceptives in Indonesia.
   Design: Confidential written questionnaire Comprising 19 questions
   designed to assess socio-economic status, religious beliefs and
   contraceptive preferences.
   Setting: Two family planning clinics; one at Birmingham Maternity
   Hospital, England (BMH), the other at Raden Saleh Klinik, Jakarta,
   Indonesia (RSK).
   Subjects: Seventy women answered the questionnaire at BMH over the
   period October to December 1993. Forty four women answered the
   questionnaire at RSK over the period March 17 to May 6 1994.
   Results: We managed to attain an almost 100 per cent response rate from
   the women at BMH by being present at the clinics, each of which
   consisted of a few women at a time. The response rate at RSK was
   impossible to assess as it was not possible to be present at every
   clinic. Therefore, we do not know how many women refused to complete the
   questionnaire there.
   The results showed that there were differences in the socio-economic
   class of the two groups with the BMH group being predominantly social
   groups I-IIIN (57 per cent) whilst the RSK group were predominantly
   groups IV-V (66 per cent). Differences were also seen with respect to
   whether the women planned to have more children; 86 per cent of the RSK
   women answered `no' compared to only 53 per cent of the BMH women.
   Analysis: Relevant percentages have been calculated and the results
   displayed as either bar charts or pie charts.
   Conclusion: English women who choose implant contraception would appear
   to be slightly older, Caucasian and from social class I, II, or IIIN. In
   general they are women who already have children and who are either
   looking to space their families or who are not planning anymore children
   but who do not want to undergo sterilisation.}},

Abstract = {{1. The River Blythe lies between the cities of Birmingham and Coventry.
   It has been notified recently as a statutory Site of Special Scientific
   Interest (SSSI) and is one of the few whole-river SSSIs in Britain.
   2. It possesses a combination of natural course and structure which is a
   rare feature of lowland rivers in England. There is a clear succession
   of plant communities from its source to its confluence with the River
   Tame. Botanically it is one of the richest rivers in England.
   3. A study in 1982 recorded 159 macroinvertebrate taxa from the river. A
   notable feature is the species richness of the molluscs, oligochaetes
   and caddis-flies.
   4. The Blythe is subject to a range of pressures including land
   drainage, recreation and development (buildings and infrastrucure). The
   appropriate option for its conservation management is limitation of
   catchment development.
   5. In order that this nationally important resource is conserved for
   future generations, a strategic approach to catchment management is
   needed combined with urban and infrastructure developments which are
   environmentally sustainable.
   6. The preparation of a catchment management strategy needs to be given
   a priority. The success of such a strategy will be dependent on
   cooperation between English Nature, the National Rivers Authority, the
   local planning authorities and the many riparian owners and occupiers.
   7. English Nature is cooperating with the National Rivers Authority to
   produce a `special ecosystem' classification so that statutory Water
   Quality Objectives can be set to protect river SSSIs like the Blythe.
   8. The goodwill of the riparian owners and occupiers is needed for the
   protection and enhancement of wildlife habitats along the river.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Henry Ellis Daniels was born in London on the second of October, 1912,
   but his family soon moved to Edinburgh. It was at the University of
   Edinburgh that he graduated; then he went on to continue studies at the
   University of Cambridge. He later took an external Ph.D. from the
   University of Edinburgh, but his periods of employment, 1935-42 and
   1945-46, as a statistician at the Wool Industries Research Association,
   Leeds, provided him with what was probably the most formative experience
   of his career. During the intervening period, 1942-45, he was Scientific
   Officer at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, working particularly on
   position finding.
   He returned to Cambridge in 1947 as a Lecturer in Mathematics; the
   Statistical Laboratory came into being during his time there. In 1957
   Henry became the first Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the
   University of Birmingham, in which post he continued until his
   retirement in 1978. Since retirement he has settled in Cambridge, where
   he has an honoured place in the Statistical Laboratory.
   Professor Daniels was President of the Royal Statistical Society for
   1974-75 and was awarded the Guy Medal of the Society, in silver in 1947
   and in gold in 1984. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
   London in 1980.
   He probably values equally the honour of being created a Liveryman of
   the Royal Company of Clockmakers in 1984: a recognition of his
   contribution to watch design. His principal hobbies are indeed the
   repair of watches and the playing of chamber music on the English
   concertina.
   The following conversation took place in his office at the Statistical
   Laboratory in Cambridge.}},

Abstract = {{Three-year-old Asian children in inner Birmingham were found to have a
   similar prevalence of behaviour and emotional disturbance to white
   English children. The Asian children had fewer sleep problems than the
   white and their mothers had less difficulty in controlling them. There
   was a difference in parental attitude to difficult behaviour between the
   two groups and also several differences in associated social variables.
   In both groups there was a high level of psychological distress in the
   mothers of the children with behaviour problems and to a lesser extent
   the fathers. Implications for service provision are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent models of industrial organisation incorporate batch production,
   flexible specialisation and network capitalism, yet histories of British
   industry have been written as successes and failures in gaining
   economies of large-scale production. The factory and the large-scale
   firm have dominated our ideas of the Industrial Revolution. These
   perspectives have been reinforced by mythologising from the early
   nineteenth century onward the divide between artisan and factory
   production. This paper points out the diversity of manufacturing
   structures and the relatively small scale of eighteenth-century
   England's first factories. It then investigates the non-factory, small-
   and medium-scale industry of the English metal trades, notably those of
   the Birmingham and Sheffield trades. The insurance and probate records
   of a broad range of producers of light metal goods show the very
   important place of a dynamic core of small- and medium-scale producers.
   These producers deployed multiple production units, specialisation and
   the division of labour, and claimed the gains of `networking' within a
   workshop economy. The position of the small- to medium-scale core was
   eroded in the early nineteenth century, leaving a rift between
   small-scale and large-scale producers. and the attendant historical
   myths of artisan and factory production. The experience of these trades
   are analysed in the light of Sokoloffs ideas of the `small scale
   factory' and the `democracy of invention,' and in the light of Alfred
   Marshall's `external economies' and Sargant Florence's `industrial
   swarming'.}},
